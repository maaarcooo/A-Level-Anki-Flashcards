Is momentum always conserved? | Yes, momentum is always conserved
What are external forces? | Forces that act on a structure or system from outside (e.g., friction and weight)
What are internal forces? | Forces exchanged by particles in the system (e.g., tension in a string)
What do 'closed' or 'isolated' systems refer to? | Systems that are not affected by external forces
What happens to total momentum in closed/isolated systems? | Total momentum is conserved
Give an example of conservation of momentum in everyday life | A swimmer diving from a boat - diver moves forward, boat moves backward
What is force defined as in terms of momentum? | The rate of change of momentum on a body
What is the equation for force in terms of momentum? | F = Δp/Δt
What is the change in momentum (Δp) equal to? | Final momentum minus initial momentum (p_final - p_before)

What is the equation for impulse? | Impulse = FΔt
What are the units for impulse? | Newton seconds (N s)
Give three examples of impulse | Kicking a ball, catching a ball, collision between two objects
Why is it difficult to directly measure impulse? | Because the force acts for only a short time, making it difficult to measure force magnitude or time
What does Newton's second law state in terms of momentum? | The resultant force on an object equals its rate of change of momentum
What is impulse equal to in terms of momentum? | Change in momentum (Δp = mv - mu)
What is the equation relating impulse to initial and final velocity? | Impulse = Δp = mv - mu
When are the impulse equations (F = Δp/Δt and Impulse = FΔt) valid? | Only when the force F is constant
What is the direction of impulse? | Always in the direction of the resultant force
A small force acting over a long time has what effect compared to a large force over a short time? | The same effect (same impulse)
What are the base units for the newton? | kg m s⁻²
Why does FΔt = Δp work dimensionally? | kg m s⁻² × s = kg m s⁻¹
Why does hail feel different from rain when hitting an umbrella? | Hailstones have larger mass and bounce back, causing greater change in momentum (greater impulse)
Why is more force required to hold an umbrella in hail than rain? | The impulse applied to hailstones is greater than to raindrops
How is impulse used to prevent injury? | By increasing the time over which the change in momentum occurs, which reduces the force experienced
Why does a cricket fielder move their hands back when catching a ball? | To increase the time for the change in momentum, reducing the force on their hands
How is impulse found on a force-time graph? | It equals the area under the force-time graph
Why is impulse equal to the area under a force-time graph? | Because Impulse = Force × Change in time
How do you find area under a curved force-time graph? | By counting the squares underneath
How do you find area under a straight-line force-time graph? | Split the graph into sections and sum the areas of each section
What is contact time? | The time during which the vehicle or passenger is in contact with the object it collided with
How are impact forces reduced? | By increasing the contact time
Name three vehicle safety features that reduce impact forces | Crumple zones, seat belts, and airbags
What do vehicle safety features do to absorb impact energy? | They change shape
How do seat belts work to reduce injury? | They stretch slightly to increase contact time, reducing force on the passenger
How do airbags work to reduce injury? | They act as a soft cushion and increase contact time, reducing force on the passenger
Where are crumple zones located on vehicles? | At the front and back of the vehicle exterior
How do crumple zones reduce force on passengers? | They crush in a controlled way, increasing the time over which momentum reaches zero
On a force-time graph, how does increased contact time affect the shape? | It produces a lower peak and wider base
What is an elastic collision? | A collision where kinetic energy is conserved
What is an inelastic collision? | A collision where kinetic energy is not conserved
Is momentum conserved in both elastic and inelastic collisions? | Yes, momentum is always conserved in both
In elastic collisions, what typically happens to the objects? | They do not stick together and move in opposite directions
In inelastic collisions, what typically happens to the objects? | They collide and stick together
What is the equation for kinetic energy? | KE = ½mv²
How do you determine if a collision is elastic or inelastic? | Compare the kinetic energy before and after the collision
What is the momentum of a stationary object? | Zero (since v = 0, p = mv = 0)
What is the kinetic energy of a stationary object? | Zero (since v = 0, KE = ½mv² = 0)
When two objects stick together after collision, how do you treat the final mass? | As a single object with mass equal to the sum of the two individual masses
What is an explosion in momentum terms? | Commonly related to recoil (e.g., gun firing bullet, nucleus emitting alpha particle)
Give an example of recoil | A gun recoiling after shooting a bullet, or an unstable nucleus emitting an alpha particle
In football, why does a player follow through after kicking? | To increase contact time, creating larger impulse and giving the ball higher velocity
