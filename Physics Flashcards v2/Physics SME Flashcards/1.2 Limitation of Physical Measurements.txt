What is the aim when making measurements of quantities? | To find the true value of that quantity
Why is it impossible to obtain the true value of any quantity? | There will always be a degree of uncertainty
What is uncertainty in measurement? | An estimate of the difference between a measurement reading and the true value
What are the two types of measurement errors that lead to uncertainty? | Random errors and systematic errors
What causes random errors? | Unpredictable fluctuations in an instrument's readings due to uncontrollable factors, such as environmental conditions
What aspect of measurements do random errors affect? | The precision of the measurements taken
How do random errors affect results? | They cause a wider spread of results about the mean value
How can random errors be reduced? | Repeat measurements several times and calculate an average from them
What causes systematic errors? | The use of faulty instruments or flaws in the experimental method
How often are systematic errors repeated? | Consistently every time the instrument is used or the method is followed
What aspect of measurements do systematic errors affect? | The accuracy of all readings obtained
How can systematic errors be reduced? | Recalibrate instruments, use different instruments, or make corrections/adjustments to the technique
What is a zero error? | A type of systematic error which occurs when an instrument gives a reading when the true reading is zero
What effect does a zero error have on readings? | It introduces a fixed error into readings which must be accounted for when results are recorded
What are precise measurements? | Measurements with very little spread about the mean value; measured values are close to each other
When can repeated measurements be described as precise? | When the values are very similar to, or the same as, each other
How is precision reflected in recorded values? | Measurements to a greater number of decimal places are more precise than those to a whole number
What is an accurate measurement? | A measurement that is close to the true value
How can accuracy be increased? | By repeating measurements and finding a mean of the results
What additional benefit does repeating measurements provide? | It helps to identify anomalies that can be omitted from the final results
What are anomalies in measurement? | Outlying data points that can be identified and omitted from final results
When is a measurement considered repeatable? | If the original experimenter repeats the investigation using the same method and equipment and obtains the same results
When is a measurement considered reproducible? | If the investigation is repeated by another person, or using different equipment or techniques, and the same results are obtained
What is resolution of a measuring instrument? | The smallest change in the quantity being measured that gives a perceptible change in the reading
What is the resolution of a typical wristwatch? | 1 second
What is the typical resolution of a digital stopclock? | 10 ms (0.01 s)
In imaging, what does resolution describe? | The ability to see two structures as two separate structures rather than as one fuzzy entity
What is the key difference between precision and accuracy? | Precision refers to how close multiple readings are to each other; accuracy is how close measurements are to the true value
Can measurements be precise but not accurate? | Yes, if each measurement reading has the same systematic error
How is uncertainty different from errors? | Errors are issues with equipment or methodology; uncertainty is a range of values around a measurement within which the true value is expected to lie
What is absolute uncertainty? | Uncertainty given as a fixed quantity
What is fractional uncertainty? | Uncertainty given as a fraction of the measurement
What is percentage uncertainty? | Uncertainty given as a percentage of the measurement
What is the formula for percentage uncertainty? | Percentage uncertainty = (uncertainty / measured value) × 100%
What is the uncertainty in a reading? | ± half the smallest division
What is the uncertainty in a measurement? | At least ±1 smallest division
How do you find the uncertainty in repeated data? | Half the range: ± ½ (largest - smallest value)
What is the uncertainty in digital readings? | ± the last significant digit (unless otherwise quoted)
To how many significant figures should absolute uncertainties be quoted? | One significant figure
To how many significant figures should fractional and percentage uncertainties be quoted? | No more than two significant figures
How should the final result be rounded when reporting uncertainty? | To match the precision of the absolute uncertainty
What units do absolute uncertainties have? | The same units as the quantity being measured
What units do percentage uncertainties have? | No units
What is the uncertainty in numbers and constants such as π? | Zero
How do you combine uncertainties when adding or subtracting data? | Add together the absolute uncertainties
How do you combine uncertainties when multiplying or dividing data? | Add the percentage or fractional uncertainties
How do you find uncertainty when raising a quantity to a power? | Multiply the percentage uncertainty by the power
What are error bars on a graph? | Bars drawn above and below a point (or side to side) that show the uncertainty in that measurement
What type of uncertainty do error bars show? | Absolute uncertainty
In which direction are error bars usually plotted? | Vertical direction (for y-values), but can also be plotted horizontally (for x-values)
How many lines of best fit are needed to calculate uncertainty in a gradient? | Two: the 'best' line and the 'worst' line
What is the 'best' line of best fit? | A line that passes as close to the points as possible
What is the 'worst' line of best fit? | Either the steepest possible or the shallowest possible line which fits within all the error bars
What is the formula for percentage uncertainty in gradient? | [(best gradient − worst gradient) / best gradient] × 100%
What is the formula for percentage uncertainty in y-intercept? | [(best y-intercept − worst y-intercept) / best y-intercept] × 100%
What rules should be followed when drawing graphs for full marks? | Use sensible scale taking up maximum paper, label axes with quantity and unit, plot points within 0.5 squares, equal points above and below best fit line, draw error bars accurately
