What is the refractive index of a material? | The ratio of how fast light travels through that particular substance compared to the speed of light in a vacuum
What is refraction? | The change in direction of a wave when it passes through a boundary between mediums of different density
What causes refraction? | A change in the speed of different parts of the wavefront as they hit the boundary
In optics, what does the term 'medium' describe? | A transparent material
What happens to waves entering a more optically dense medium? | The waves travel slower and the angle of refraction is smaller (light bends towards the normal)
What happens to waves entering a less optically dense medium? | The waves travel faster and the angle of refraction is larger (light bends away from the normal)
How are the angles of incidence and refraction measured? | From the normal line, which is drawn at 90° to the boundary between the two media
What is the angle of incidence? | The angle between the approaching incident ray and the normal
What is the angle of refraction? | The angle between the ray leaving the boundary and the normal
When light passes from a less dense to a more dense medium, how does the refracted light differ from the incident light? | It has a lower speed and a shorter wavelength
When light passes from a more dense to a less dense medium, how does the refracted light differ from the incident light? | It has a higher speed and a longer wavelength
When a wave refracts, which properties change and which remain constant? | Speed and wavelength change, but frequency remains the same
How can you tell that frequency doesn't change during refraction? | The colour of the wave does not change
What happens when a light ray is incident on a boundary at 90°? | The wave passes straight through without changing direction (the whole wavefront enters at the same time)
What is the equation for refractive index? | n = c / cₛ, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum and cₛ is the speed of light in the substance
What are the units of refractive index? | It is dimensionless (has no units) because it is a ratio
Why is the refractive index always greater than 1? | Because the speed of light in a substance is always less than the speed of light in a vacuum
What is the refractive index of air in calculations? | Approximately 1
What is an optically dense material? | A material with a high refractive index that causes light to travel slower
What does Snell's Law relate? | The angle of incidence to the angle of refraction at a boundary between two media
State Snell's Law equation | n₁ sin θ₁ = n₂ sin θ₂
In Snell's Law, what do n₁ and n₂ represent? | n₁ is the refractive index of material 1, n₂ is the refractive index of material 2
In Snell's Law, what do θ₁ and θ₂ represent? | θ₁ is the angle of incidence in material 1, θ₂ is the angle of refraction in material 2
What is the critical angle? | The angle of incidence at which the angle of refraction equals 90° and the refracted ray travels along the boundary
What is the relationship between refractive index and critical angle? | The larger the refractive index, the smaller the critical angle
What happens when the angle of incidence equals the critical angle? | The angle of refraction is 90° and the refracted ray travels along the boundary between the two materials
What happens when the angle of incidence is less than the critical angle? | The ray is refracted and exits the material
What happens when the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle? | The ray undergoes total internal reflection
What is the equation for critical angle? | sin θc = n₂ / n₁
What two conditions are required for total internal reflection? | 1) The angle of incidence must be greater than the critical angle (i > θc), 2) The incident medium must have a higher refractive index than the boundary medium (n₁ > n₂)
What law does total internal reflection follow? | The law of reflection: angle of incidence = angle of reflection
How does refractive index relate to optical density? | A denser medium has a higher refractive index
What are optical fibres used for? | Communications (telephone and internet transmission) and medical imaging (endoscopes)
What are the three main components of an optical fibre? | An optically dense core tube, a lower optically dense cladding surrounding the core, and an outer sheath
What is a step-index fibre? | An optical fibre where the refractive index increases moving from the outside to the centre (cladding to core)
For TIR to occur in an optical fibre, what must be true about the refractive indices? | n(cladding) < n(core)
What is the role of cladding in an optical fibre? | Protects the core from damage, prevents signal degradation through light escaping, keeps signals secure, and keeps the core separate from other fibres
What is pulse broadening? | When the pulses emerging from an optical fibre are longer than those entering
What causes pulse broadening? | Material dispersion and modal dispersion
What is material dispersion? | When white light is separated into all colours of the spectrum inside an optical fibre because each wavelength travels at different speeds
Why does violet light take longer to travel down an optical fibre? | It has the shortest wavelength so travels slowest, giving it the smallest angle of incidence/reflection, resulting in more reflections
What is modal dispersion? | When monochromatic light pulses spread out because each part of the wavefront has a different angle of incidence and undergoes TIR a different number of times
When is modal dispersion more prominent? | When the core of the fibre is wider
How can modal dispersion be prevented? | By using a very narrow core
What is absorption in an optical fibre? | When the fibre absorbs part of the signal's energy, reducing the amplitude and causing information loss
What are three ways to reduce absorption in optical fibres? | Use an extremely transparent core, use optical fibre repeaters to regenerate the pulse
What are four ways to reduce pulse broadening? | Use a narrow core, use a monochromatic source, use optical fibre repeaters, use a single-mode fibre
What is a single-mode fibre? | An optical fibre where only a single wavelength of light passes through the core to reduce multipath modal dispersion
What happens to light when it enters an optical fibre? | It refracts when entering, undergoes repeated total internal reflection against the sides, then refracts back out at the other end
Why do light signals travel long distances in optical fibres without losing information? | Total internal reflection preserves the signal, and the fibre is designed to minimise absorption and dispersion
What determines the amount of refraction at a boundary? | The difference between the angles of incidence and refraction, which depends on the difference in optical density between the two media
Which colour of visible light travels slowest in a medium? | Violet (shortest wavelength)
Why is monochromatic light preferred in optical fibres? | To ensure the speed of the pulse is constant and reduce material dispersion
What effect does pulse broadening have on signal quality? | It can result in merging of pulses, distorting information and decreasing signal amplitude
How do optical fibre repeaters help maintain signal quality? | They regenerate the pulse before significant absorption or pulse broadening has taken place
The refractive index of a material is the ratio of how fast light travels through that substance compared to the speed of light in a vacuum | What is the definition of refractive index?
The change in direction of a wave when it passes through a boundary between mediums of different density | What is the definition of refraction?
