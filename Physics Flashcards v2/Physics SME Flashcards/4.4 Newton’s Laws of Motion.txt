What do Newton's laws of motion describe? | The relationship between the forces acting on objects and the motion of the objects
State Newton's First Law of Motion. | An object will remain at rest or move with constant velocity unless acted on by a resultant force
According to Newton's First Law, what will happen to an object at rest if no resultant force acts on it? | It will remain at rest
According to Newton's First Law, what will happen to an object moving at constant velocity if no resultant force acts on it? | It will remain moving at that constant velocity
What is required to change the motion of an object? | A resultant force
Name three ways a resultant force can change an object's motion. | To speed up, to slow down, or to change direction
If the forces on a body are balanced (resultant force is 0), what are the two possible states of the body? | At rest, or moving at a constant velocity
Why is it easier to split forces into horizontal and vertical components? | Because force is a vector quantity
If horizontal forces are balanced, what is true about the forces? | The forces acting to the left equal the forces acting to the right
If vertical forces are balanced, what is true about the forces? | The forces acting upward equal the forces acting downward
What is the resultant force? | The vector sum of all the forces acting on a body
What does Newton's Second Law describe? | The change in motion that arises from a resultant force acting on an object
State Newton's Second Law of Motion. | The resultant force acting on an object with a constant mass is directly proportional to its acceleration
Write the equation for Newton's Second Law. | F = ma
In F = ma, what does F represent and what is its unit? | Resultant force, measured in newtons (N)
In F = ma, what does m represent and what is its unit? | Mass of object, measured in kilograms (kg)
In F = ma, what does a represent and what is its unit? | Acceleration, measured in metres per second squared (m s⁻²)
In what direction does acceleration always act relative to the resultant force? | In the same direction as the resultant force
What happens when unbalanced forces act on an object? | The object experiences a resultant force
If a resultant force acts along the direction of an object's motion, what will happen to the object? | It will speed up (accelerate) or slow down (decelerate)
If a resultant force acts at an angle to an object's direction of motion, what will happen? | The object will change direction
Force is what type of quantity? | A vector quantity with both magnitude and direction
If an object is in motion, which direction is considered positive? | The direction of motion
If the resultant force acts at an angle to motion, how can the magnitude and direction be found? | By combining vectors or using scale drawings
What type of quantity is acceleration? | A vector quantity with both magnitude and direction
When is acceleration positive? | When the resultant force acts in the direction of an object's motion
When is acceleration negative? | When the resultant force opposes the direction of the object's motion
What happens to a falling object's acceleration if no drag forces are present? | The acceleration is independent of its mass
State Newton's Second Law in terms of momentum. | The resultant force on an object is equal to its rate of change of momentum
In what direction is the change in momentum relative to the resultant force? | In the same direction as the resultant force
Write the equation for momentum. | p = mv
Write the equation for rate of change of momentum. | Δp/Δt = m(Δv/Δt)
Write the equation linking force to rate of change of velocity. | F = m(Δv/Δt)
Write the equation for acceleration in terms of change in velocity. | a = Δv/Δt
What do Newton's First and Second Laws deal with? | Multiple forces acting on a single object
What does Newton's Third Law deal with? | The forces involved when two objects interact
State Newton's Third Law of Motion. | If Object A exerts a force on Object B, then Object B will exert a force on Object A which is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction
When two objects interact, how do the forces arise? | In pairs (third-law pairs)
What four criteria must a Newton's Third Law force pair meet? | Same type of force, same magnitude, opposite in direction, acting on different objects
A Newton's Third Law force pair must be the same type of what? | The same type of force
A Newton's Third Law force pair must have the same what? | The same magnitude
A Newton's Third Law force pair must be opposite in what? | Direction
A Newton's Third Law force pair must act on what? | Different objects
In the walking example, what are the two forces in the third-law pair? | The foot pushes on the ground and the ground pushes back on the foot
What type of force is involved in the walking third-law pair? | Normal contact force (also called support force or normal reaction force)
What is another name for the normal contact force? | Support force or normal reaction force
Why are weight and normal contact force on a book NOT a Newton's Third Law pair? | They are not the same type of force and both act on the same object
For a book on a table, what is the third-law pair for the normal contact force? | The book pushes on the table and the table pushes back on the book (both contact forces)
For a book on a table, what is the third-law pair for weight? | The book pulls on the Earth and the Earth pulls on the book (both gravitational forces)
What is a free-body force diagram used for? | Showing multiple forces acting on one object
If forces on an object are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, does this mean they are a Newton's Third Law pair? | Not necessarily - they must also be the same type of force and act on different objects
What common misconception did Newton's First Law challenge? | The widely held belief that any moving object would naturally slow down to a stop
Can an object be in motion with no resultant force acting on it? | Yes, it will move at constant velocity
What does a resultant force that opposes an object's motion cause? | The object to decelerate (not to suddenly travel backwards)
If a car moves at constant velocity, what can be said about the driving force and frictional force? | They are balanced (equal in magnitude, opposite in direction)
What is the general rule for assigning positive direction in force calculations? | Consider the direction of the object's motion as positive
For stationary objects, what convention is generally assumed for positive and negative directions? | Forward, upwards, and to the right are positive; backward, downwards, and to the left are negative
How do you calculate the resultant force when multiple forces act on an object? | Add all forces as vectors, considering their directions (positive and negative)
