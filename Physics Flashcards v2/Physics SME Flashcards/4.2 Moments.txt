What is a moment? | The turning effect of a force
What is the turning effect of a force called? | A moment
What causes moments to occur? | Forces causing objects to rotate about some pivot
What is the equation for the moment of a force? | Moment (N m) = Force (N) × perpendicular distance from the pivot (m)
What is the SI unit for moment? | Newton metres (N m)
What unit is moment measured in? | Newton metres (N m) or Newton centimetres (N cm)
Why is a door handle placed far from the hinge? | To maximise the distance for a given force, providing a greater moment (turning force)
If a force is not perpendicular to the distance, how do you calculate the moment? | Use the component of the distance which is perpendicular to the force: Moment = F × d cos(θ)
What does the principle of moments state? | For a system to be in equilibrium, the sum of clockwise moments about a point must be equal to the sum of anticlockwise moments about the same point
For a system in equilibrium, what must be true about the moments? | The sum of clockwise moments must equal the sum of anticlockwise moments about any point
What is a couple? | A pair of equal and opposite coplanar forces that acts to produce rotation only
What does a couple produce? | Rotation only
What are the three conditions for forces to form a couple? | Equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, and perpendicular to the distance between them
Why does a couple produce zero resultant force? | Because the two forces are equal and opposite, they cancel out
Why does an object acted on by a couple not accelerate linearly? | Because couples produce a resultant force of zero, so F = ma gives zero acceleration
How does the moment of a couple differ from the moment of a single force? | The moment of a couple doesn't depend on a pivot
What is the equation for the moment of a couple? | Force × perpendicular distance between the lines of action of the forces
Can the forces of a couple share the same line of action? | No, they must have different lines of action
What is the line of action of a force? | The line through the point at which the force is applied
What is the centre of mass of an object? | The point at which the weight of the object may be considered to act
At what point may the weight of an object be considered to act? | The centre of mass
Where is the centre of mass located for a uniform regular solid? | At its centre
Where is the centre of mass for symmetrical objects with uniform density? | At the point of symmetry
Where is the approximate centre of mass of a person standing upright? | Roughly in the middle of the body behind the navel
Where is the centre of mass of a sphere? | At the centre
What affects the stability of an object? | The position of its centre of mass
When is an object stable? | When its centre of mass lies above its base
When will an object topple over? | When its centre of mass is no longer over its base
How does a wide base affect an object's centre of mass and stability? | A wider base gives a lower centre of mass and more stability
How does a narrow base affect an object's centre of mass and stability? | A narrower base gives a higher centre of mass and the object is more likely to topple
What two features make an object most stable? | A wide base and a low centre of mass
In a uniform gravitational field, how do centre of gravity and centre of mass compare? | They are identical
Does the centre of mass depend on the gravitational field? | No, the centre of mass does not depend on the gravitational field
Does the centre of gravity depend on the gravitational field? | Yes, since weight = mass × acceleration due to gravity
Why does centre of gravity depend on the gravitational field? | Because weight = mass × g, and g varies with the gravitational field
When an object is in space between two bodies, where will its centre of gravity be shifted? | Towards the object with the larger gravitational field
Can the centre of mass lie outside a body? | Yes, since the centre of mass is a hypothetical point, it can lie inside or outside of a body
Does the centre of mass of an object remain fixed? | No, it constantly shifts depending on the shape of the body
What is a pivot? | The point about which an object rotates when a moment is applied
For a uniform beam, where does its weight act? | At its centre of gravity (the middle of the beam)
What must be true about distances when applying the principle of moments? | All distances must be in the same units
What type of rotation does a force to the left of a pivot (acting downward) produce? | Anticlockwise rotation
What type of rotation does a force to the right of a pivot (acting downward) produce? | Clockwise rotation
