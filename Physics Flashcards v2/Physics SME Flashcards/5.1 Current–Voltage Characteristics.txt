For an ohmic conductor, what is the relationship between current and potential difference? | Current is directly proportional to potential difference
What is a diode used for in a circuit? | To allow current to flow only in a specific direction
What is forward bias in a diode? | When the current flows in the direction of the arrowhead symbol (diode conducts)
What is reverse bias in a diode? | When the diode is switched around and does not conduct
Why does the I-V graph for a filament lamp curve? | As current increases, temperature increases, which increases resistance, causing current to increase at a slower rate
Why does increased temperature cause increased resistance in a filament lamp? | Because the filament is a metal, and higher temperature causes increased resistance in metals
