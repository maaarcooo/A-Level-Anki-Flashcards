What is polarisation? | When particle oscillations occur in a single plane perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation
Which type of waves can be polarised? | Only transverse waves
Why can only transverse waves be polarised? | Because transverse waves oscillate in any plane perpendicular to the propagation direction

Besides using a polarising filter, how else can light be polarised? | Through reflection, refraction, and scattering
When two polarisers have their transmission axes parallel, what happens to light intensity? | Maximum intensity of light is transmitted
When two polarisers have their transmission axes perpendicular to each other, what happens to light intensity? | Minimum intensity (zero) of light is transmitted
What happens to light intensity as one polariser is rotated through 360° relative to another? | Intensity varies periodically between maximum and zero
At what angle between transmission axes is light intensity at zero? | 90° (and 270°)

What happens to the intensity of unpolarised light after passing through a polarising filter? | It reduces
How are Polaroid sunglasses oriented? | With vertically oriented polarising filters
What do Polaroid sunglasses block? | Horizontally polarised light
What happens to light when it reflects from a horizontal reflective surface? | It undergoes partial plane polarisation (becoming partially horizontally polarised)
Why are Polaroid sunglasses useful near water? | They reduce glare by eliminating the partially horizontally polarised light reflected from the water surface
Why can objects underwater be viewed more clearly with polaroid sunglasses? | Because the glare from the surface is eliminated while light from underwater objects (which is refracted, not reflected) passes through
How do polarising filters help photographers take photos of underwater objects? | They eliminate the horizontally polarised glare from the surface while allowing the refracted light from underwater objects to pass through
How are radio and television signals broadcast in terms of polarisation? | Either horizontally-polarised or vertically-polarised
Why must TV aerials be mounted in a specific orientation? | To match the polarisation of the signal being broadcast (horizontal or vertical)
