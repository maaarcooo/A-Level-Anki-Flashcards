What happens to charge when it passes through a power supply such as a battery? | It gains electrical energy
What is electromotive force (e.m.f)? | The amount of chemical energy converted to electrical energy per coulomb of charge when passing through a power supply
The amount of chemical energy converted to electrical energy per coulomb of charge when passing through a power supply is the definition of what? | Electromotive force (e.m.f)
What symbol represents e.m.f? | ε (Greek letter epsilon)
What unit is e.m.f measured in? | Volts (V)
Is e.m.f actually a force? | No, despite its name it is not a force
What is e.m.f equal to when no current is flowing? | The potential difference across the cell
How can e.m.f be measured in an open circuit? | By connecting a high-resistance voltmeter around the terminals of the cell
Why must the voltmeter have high resistance when measuring e.m.f? | So that negligible current flows through the circuit
Write the equation for e.m.f in terms of energy and charge | ε = E/Q where E is energy and Q is charge
What is terminal potential difference (p.d)? | The potential difference across the terminals of a cell
Why is the terminal p.d always lower than the e.m.f? | Because a cell has internal resistance
What happens in a closed circuit when current flows through a cell? | A potential difference develops across the internal resistance
Why does internal resistance reduce the voltage available to the external circuit? | Because resistance opposes current, reducing the energy per unit charge (voltage) available
What is 'lost volts'? | The work done per unit charge to overcome the internal resistance inside the battery when current flows
What symbol represents lost volts? | v (lowercase)
The work done per unit charge to overcome the internal resistance inside the battery is the definition of what? | Lost volts
Write the equation relating lost volts to e.m.f and terminal p.d | v = ε − V
Write the equation for lost volts using Ohm's law | v = Ir where I is current and r is internal resistance
Write the full e.m.f equation showing all components | ε = IR + Ir = I(R + r)
In the equation ε = IR + Ir, what does IR represent? | Terminal p.d (voltage across the load resistor)
In the equation ε = IR + Ir, what does Ir represent? | Lost volts (voltage lost across internal resistance)
E.m.f can be defined as the total or maximum what available to the circuit? | Voltage
What is internal resistance? | The resistance of the materials within the battery
The resistance of the materials within the battery is the definition of what? | Internal resistance
What symbol represents internal resistance? | r
Why does a cell become warm after being used for a period of time? | Internal resistance causes the charge to dissipate some electrical energy from the power supply itself
What does internal resistance cause over time in a power supply? | Loss of voltage or energy loss
How can a cell be modelled in a circuit? | As a source of e.m.f with an internal resistance connected in series
What is the 'load resistor' in a circuit? | The external resistance R in the circuit
If a battery has negligible internal resistance, what assumption can be made? | The e.m.f of the battery is equal to its voltage
When must e.m.f equations be used in calculations? | When the battery in the circuit includes internal resistance
What is the aim of the EMF & internal resistance practical? | To investigate the relationship between e.m.f and internal resistance by measuring the variation of current and voltage using a variable resistor
What is the independent variable in the EMF practical? | Resistance, R (Ω)
What are the dependent variables in the EMF practical? | Voltage, V (V) and current, I (A)
What are the control variables in the EMF practical? | E.m.f of the cell and internal resistance of the cell
Why should the switch be opened between readings in the EMF practical? | To prevent the internal resistance of the battery from changing during the experiment
How many readings should be taken in the EMF practical? | A minimum of 8-10 readings
Write the rearranged e.m.f equation in the form V = ... | V = −rI + ε
When plotting V against I, what does the gradient represent? | −r (negative internal resistance)
When plotting V against I, what does the y-intercept represent? | ε (e.m.f)
Why should the switch only be closed briefly when taking readings? | To prevent the internal resistance from changing during the experiment (systematic error)
Why should only fairly new cells be used in the EMF practical? | Because e.m.f and internal resistance of run-down batteries can vary during the experiment
How can random errors be reduced in the EMF practical? | Take multiple repeat readings (at least 3) for each voltage and current and calculate a mean
Why should you wait before recording voltmeter and ammeter values? | For the readings to stabilise (stop fluctuating)
What safety precaution relates to electrical components getting hot? | Switch off the power supply right away if you smell burning
Why should liquids be kept away from the EMF practical equipment? | As this could damage the electrical equipment
What resolution should the voltmeter have in the EMF practical? | 1 mV
What resolution should the ammeter have in the EMF practical? | 0.1 mA
How do you calculate current from e.m.f and total resistance? | I = ε/(R + r)
If ε = 7.3 V, R = 9.5 Ω, and r = 0.3 Ω, what is the current? | I = 7.3/(9.5 + 0.3) = 0.74 A (2 s.f.)
How do you calculate lost volts if you know current and internal resistance? | Lost volts = I × r
What is the relationship between V, I, and R for terminal p.d? | V = IR
In the V-I graph for a cell, why is the gradient negative? | Because increasing current causes more voltage to be lost across internal resistance, reducing terminal p.d
What does a steeper negative gradient on a V-I graph indicate about internal resistance? | Higher internal resistance
At what point on a V-I graph does V equal the e.m.f? | Where I = 0 (the y-intercept)
What equation relates e.m.f, current, load resistance and internal resistance? | ε = I(R + r)
Rearrange I = ε/(R + r) to make R the subject | R = (ε/I) − r
Rearrange ε = V + Ir to make r the subject | r = (ε − V)/I
What type of error is caused by internal resistance changing during the experiment? | Systematic error
Why is it important to use the whole range of the variable resistor? | To obtain data points across the full range for accurate graph plotting
