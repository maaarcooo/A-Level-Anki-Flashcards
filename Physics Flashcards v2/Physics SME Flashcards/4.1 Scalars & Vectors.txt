For an object on a slope, which direction is the weight? | Vertically downwards
For an object on a slope, which direction is the normal (reaction) force? | Perpendicular to the slope surface (vertically up from the object)
What is the component of weight perpendicular to a slope at angle θ? | W cos θ
What is the component of weight parallel to a slope at angle θ? | W sin θ

When are forces in equilibrium? | When an object is at rest or moving at constant velocity
How are coplanar forces in equilibrium represented? | By closed vector triangles
What does it mean for vectors to form a closed path? | When joined together head-to-tail, the vectors form a complete triangle with no gap
Name four common forces acting on objects | Weight, normal reaction force, tension, friction
What happens to a vector triangle when forces are in equilibrium? | The vectors form a closed triangle (no resultant)
How do you subtract vectors? | Reverse the direction of the vector being subtracted, then add using triangle or parallelogram method
