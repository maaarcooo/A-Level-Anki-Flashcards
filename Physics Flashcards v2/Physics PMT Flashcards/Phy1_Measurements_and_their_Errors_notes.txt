Does precision indicate accuracy? | No, precise measurements don't indicate the value is accurate
What is repeatability? | When the original experimenter can redo the experiment with the same equipment and method and get the same results
What is reproducibility? | When a different person or different techniques and equipment give the same results
What is resolution? | The smallest change in the quantity being measured that gives a recognisable change in reading
What is accuracy? | A measurement close to the true value
What is uncertainty? | The bounds in which the accurate value can be expected to lie
What is absolute uncertainty? | Uncertainty given as a fixed quantity (e.g. 7 ± 0.6 V)
What is fractional uncertainty? | Uncertainty as a fraction of the measurement (e.g. 7 ± 3/35 V)

How can you reduce percentage and fractional uncertainty? | Measure larger quantities
What is a reading? | When one value is found (e.g. reading a thermometer)
What is a measurement? | When the difference between 2 readings is found (e.g. using a ruler)
What is the uncertainty in a reading? | ± half the smallest division
What is the uncertainty in a measurement? | At least ±1 smallest division
Why is the uncertainty in a ruler measurement ±1mm? | Because both the start and end readings have ±0.5mm uncertainty, which are added together
How is uncertainty treated for digital readings? | Either quoted or assumed to be ± the last significant digit
For repeated data, how is uncertainty calculated? | Half the range (largest - smallest value)
How can you reduce uncertainty when using a ruler? | Fix one end so only one reading uncertainty is included
