What is material dispersion? | Waves of different wavelengths travel at slightly different speeds through an optical fibre, reaching the end at different times, causing pulse broadening.
How can material dispersion be reduced? | By using monochromatic light.
What is modal dispersion? | Waves entering an optical fibre at slightly different angles travel different distances, reaching the end at different times, causing pulse broadening.
What is a node? | A position of minimum displacement in a stationary wave.
A position of minimum displacement in a stationary wave is called what? | A node

What is phase? | A measure of how far through the wave's cycle a given point on the wave is.
What is polarisation? | The restriction of a wave so that it can only oscillate in a single plane.
Which type of wave can be polarised? | Transverse waves only.
What is pulse broadening? | The elongation of a signal passed down an optical fibre.
What are the two main causes of pulse broadening? | Modal dispersion and material dispersion.
What is refractive index? | A material property equal to the ratio between the speed of light in a vacuum and the speed of light in a given material.
What is Snell's Law? | A law linking a wave's angle of incidence to its angle of refraction using the refractive indexes of the mediums involved.
