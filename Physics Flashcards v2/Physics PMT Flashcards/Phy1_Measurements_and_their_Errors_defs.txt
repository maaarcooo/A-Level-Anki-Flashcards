What is accuracy? | A measure of how close a measurement is to the true value
A measure of how close a measurement is to the true value is the definition of what? | Accuracy
What is precision? | A measure of how close a measurement is to the mean value
A measure of how close a measurement is to the mean value is the definition of what? | Precision
Does precision indicate how close data is to the true value? | No, it only indicates the magnitude of random errors
What is a random error? | Unpredictable variation between measurements that leads to a spread of values about the true value
Unpredictable variation between measurements that leads to a spread of values about the true value describes what type of error? | Random error
How can random error be reduced? | By taking repeat measurements
What is a systematic error? | An error that causes all readings to differ from the true value by a fixed amount
An error that causes all readings to differ from the true value by a fixed amount describes what type of error? | Systematic error
Can systematic error be corrected by repeat readings? | No, a different technique or apparatus should be used instead
How can systematic error be corrected? | By using a different technique or apparatus
What does repeatable mean? | The same experimenter can repeat a measurement using the same method and equipment and obtain the same value
The same experimenter repeating a measurement with the same method and equipment to obtain the same value describes what term? | Repeatable
What does reproducible mean? | An experiment can be repeated by a different experimenter using a different method and different apparatus, and still obtain the same results
An experiment repeated by a different experimenter using different method and apparatus that still obtains the same results describes what term? | Reproducible
What is the difference between repeatable and reproducible? | Repeatable involves the same experimenter, method and equipment; reproducible involves different experimenter, method and apparatus
What is resolution? | The smallest change in a quantity that causes a visible change in the reading that a measuring instrument records
The smallest change in a quantity that causes a visible change in an instrument's reading is the definition of what? | Resolution
What is uncertainty? | The interval that a value is said to lie within, with a given level of confidence
The interval that a value is said to lie within, with a given level of confidence, is the definition of what? | Uncertainty
