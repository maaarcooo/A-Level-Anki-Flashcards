What is the formula for critical angle? | sin θc = n₂/n₁, where n₁ > n₂
What two conditions are required for total internal reflection (TIR)? | The angle of incidence must be greater than the critical angle, and n₁ must be greater than n₂
What are optical fibres? | Flexible, thin tubes of plastic or glass that carry information as light signals using total internal reflection
Why do optical fibres have cladding? | To allow TIR to occur (lower optical density than core), protect the core from damage, and prevent signal degradation through light escaping
What is absorption in optical fibres? | Part of the signal's energy is absorbed by the fibre, reducing amplitude and potentially losing information
What is pulse broadening? | When the received signal is broader than the original transmitted signal, which can cause signals to overlap
