What is stopping potential? | The minimum potential difference required to stop the highest kinetic energy electrons from leaving the metal plate in the photoelectric effect
What are strange particles? | Particles that are produced through the strong interaction but decay through the weak interaction
What is strangeness? | A quantum number that is conserved in strong interactions but not in weak interactions
Why is strangeness not conserved in weak interactions? | Because strange particles are always produced in pairs (in strong interactions) but can decay individually (via weak interaction)
