Where should the link to an external CSS stylesheet be placed? | In the header section of the HTML document
What is the basic syntax structure of CSS? | Selector name followed by curly brackets containing attribute definitions (e.g., selector { property: value; })
What is JavaScript? | A scripting language which primarily exists to add interactivity to websites
Is JavaScript interpreted or compiled? | Interpreted
Why is JavaScript being interpreted beneficial for web pages? | Web pages can be interpreted by the browser each time they are loaded, independently of processor architecture
What is a common use of JavaScript? | Validating input data on the client computer
Name three advantages of using JavaScript for input validation | 1) Local computer handles invalid data before sending to servers 2) Eases load on busy servers 3) Reduces web traffic
How do you select an HTML element by ID in JavaScript? | document.getElementById("elementId")
How do you change the content of an HTML element using JavaScript? | element.innerHTML = "new content"
How do you write directly to an HTML document using JavaScript? | document.write("content")
How do you display an alert box in JavaScript? | alert("message")
What is a search engine? | A program that searches through a database of internet addresses looking for resources based on criteria set by the client
Why is the order of search results important? | It determines which websites users choose to visit, so high-quality relevant content should appear at the top
What do search engines rely on to return results? | An index of web pages
What are web crawlers? | Programs used to collect information about websites to build the search engine index (also called spiders)
What is another name for web crawlers? | Spiders
How do web crawlers work? | They traverse the Internet page by page using links, collecting keywords, phrases, and metadata from websites
What information do web crawlers collect from websites? | Keywords, phrases from linked pages, and metadata specified by website owners
What is metadata in the context of web crawlers? | Information specified by the website owner that describes the website
What does the PageRank algorithm do? | Ranks web pages to determine the order in which they are displayed in search results
What two factors determine the PageRank of a webpage? | 1) How many incoming links it has from other web pages 2) The page rank of the web pages that link to it
What data structure is used to represent web page links in PageRank? | A directed graph
In the PageRank graph structure, what do nodes represent? | Web pages
In the PageRank graph structure, what do arcs represent? | Links between web pages
What is the PageRank algorithm formula? | PageRank(x) = (1-d) + d[(PageRank(T1) ÷ Count(T1)) + ... + (PageRank(Tn) ÷ Count(Tn))]
In the PageRank formula, what does d represent? | The damping factor
What is the typical value of the damping factor (d) in PageRank? | 0.85
In the PageRank formula, what does Count(Tn) represent? | The total count of outbound links from webpage n
What initial value is assumed for unknown PageRank values in the first iteration? | 1
Why is the PageRank algorithm iterative? | Each iteration refines the values using results from the previous iteration until values converge
What additional factors do modern search engines consider beyond basic PageRank? | Age of a web page and how quickly content loads
What is server side processing? | When a client sends data to a server for it to be processed, with no processing on the client computer
Name two common server side scripting languages | SQL and PHP
What are the advantages of server side processing? | Does not require plugins, can perform large calculations faster, not browser dependent, more secure
What is client side processing? | When a client processes data on a local device, with all information processed on the client computer
What is another name for client side processing? | Client side scripting
What language is commonly used for client side scripting? | JavaScript
What are the advantages of client side processing? | Webpage can immediately respond to user actions, executes quickly, gives developers more control over website behaviour and appearance
Why is server side processing more secure than client side? | Processing happens on the server, so sensitive code and data are not exposed to the client
Why can server side processing perform large calculations faster? | Servers typically have more processing power than client computers
Why does client side processing execute quickly? | No need to send data to a server and wait for a response
A language used to describe the style of a webpage | CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
A scripting language that adds interactivity to websites | JavaScript
A program that searches a database of internet addresses for resources | Search engine
Programs that traverse the internet collecting information for search engine indexes | Web crawlers (spiders)
An algorithm that ranks web pages based on incoming links and link quality | PageRank algorithm
Processing where data is sent to a server for computation | Server side processing
Processing where data is computed on the local device | Client side processing
Information specified by website owners that describes their website | Metadata
The factor in PageRank typically set to 0.85 | Damping factor (d)
Attributes used to style specific elements on a webpage | Classes and identifiers
