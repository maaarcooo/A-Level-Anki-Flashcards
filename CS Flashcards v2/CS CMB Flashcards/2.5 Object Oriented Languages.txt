What is a class in OOP? | A blueprint or template used to create objects with specific attributes and methods
What is created from a class? | An object (a specific instance of a class)
What does OOP stand for? | Object Oriented Programming
What two things does an object have that are its own? | State and behaviours
What benefit does using classes provide for code? | Reusable and organised code in a modular way
What are attributes in a class? | Variables within a class that define the properties/data of objects
What is another name for attributes within a class definition? | Class variables
What is another name for attributes within an object? | Instance variables
What is instantiation? | The process of creating an object from a class
What is the identifier in OOP? | The name used to refer to an object
What are prebuilt classes? | Classes already included in a programming language that provide common functionality
Give an example of a prebuilt class in Java for working with dates | Date and Calendar classes
Give an example of a prebuilt class in Java for working with text | String class
Give an example of a prebuilt class in Java for generating random numbers | Random class
Give an example of a prebuilt class in Java for reading input | Scanner class
What are custom classes? | Classes created by the programmer to define new data types
A blueprint or template used to create objects is called a... | Class
The process of creating an object from a class is called... | Instantiation
Variables within a class are also known as... | Attributes or class variables
What is an object in OOP? | A representation of a real-world entity created from a class with its own unique values
What is a constructor? | A special method within a class that is automatically called when an object is instantiated
What do constructors typically do? | Define the initial values of instance variables and perform setup to prepare the object for use
A special method automatically called when an object is created is called a... | Constructor
What is a method in OOP? | A function associated with an object or class that defines behaviour and actions the object can perform
What are the two main types of methods? | Functions and procedures
What is a function (in the context of methods)? | A method that performs a task and returns a value
What is a procedure (in the context of methods)? | A method that performs a task but does not return a value
A method that must return a value is called a... | Function
A method that does not need to return a value is called a... | Procedure
What notation is used to call methods on objects? | Dot notation (e.g., objectName.methodName())
What are instance methods? | Methods associated with individual instances (objects) of a class that operate on specific object data
What are static methods? | Methods associated with a class itself that can be called without creating an instance of the class
What is a public method? | A method accessible and invokable by any code within the same class or from external classes
What is a private method? | A method only accessible within the same class, cannot be invoked by external code
What is the default access level if public or private is not specified for a method? | Public
Why should changes to public methods be made carefully? | They may impact other parts of the codebase, so should be backward compatible
What is an attribute in OOP? | A data member or property associated with an object or class that defines its state
What do attributes define about an object? | The state of the object
What data types can attributes have? | Various types such as integers, strings, Booleans, or other objects
Can attributes have different access rights? | Yes, they can be public or private
What is a private attribute? | An attribute that can only be accessed by instances of its own class
Can local variables (declared within methods) have access modifiers? | No, they are local to the method and have limited scope
A data member that defines the state of an object is called a/an... | Attribute
What is inheritance in OOP? | A concept that allows a class to inherit the properties and behaviours (methods and attributes) of another class
What does inheritance promote? | Code reuse by allowing derived classes to inherit and utilise existing code from the base class
What type of relationship does inheritance establish? | An "IS-A" relationship between the base class and derived class
What is a base class? | The parent class or superclass from which other classes inherit
What is a derived class? | The child class or subclass that inherits characteristics from a base class
What is another name for a base class? | Parent class or superclass
What is another name for a derived class? | Child class or subclass
What can a derived class do in addition to inheriting from the base class? | Add additional attributes and methods
What does the super keyword do in inheritance? | Refers to the superclass and allows access to its members (methods, attributes, or constructors) from within the subclass
A class that inherits from another class is called a... | Derived class (or child class/subclass)
The class from which another class inherits is called a... | Base class (or parent class/superclass)
What is encapsulation in OOP? | The practice of grouping data (attributes) and methods (functions) within a class
What does encapsulation ensure about data? | That data remains secure and is not accidentally modified or misused
How does encapsulation control access to data? | By using access modifiers (e.g., public, private)
What does encapsulation help with regarding code organisation? | Keeps related data and methods together within an object
What concept does encapsulation use to reduce complexity? | Abstraction
What is abstraction in the context of encapsulation? | Hiding the implementation details of an object, making it easier to understand and work with
How can external code interact with an encapsulated class? | Using public methods without needing to understand internal details
What is the benefit of encapsulation for code reusability? | The same object or class can be used in different parts of a program without rewriting code
The practice of grouping data and methods within a class while controlling access is called... | Encapsulation
Hiding implementation details from external code is a concept called... | Abstraction
What is polymorphism in OOP? | A concept that allows objects to take on different forms or behaviours
What does polymorphism allow different objects to share? | The same name or behaviour but work in different ways
What benefits does polymorphism provide? | Makes code more flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain
What is method overloading? | Having multiple methods with the same name but different implementations in different classes
What is method overriding? | Providing a new implementation in a derived class for a method already defined in the parent class
What keyword is used to provide a new implementation for an inherited method? | The override keyword
What does polymorphism allow regarding objects and common groups? | Objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass or base class
How can polymorphism benefit data storage? | Allows an array of a base type to store objects of different derived types
A concept allowing objects to take different forms or behaviours is called... | Polymorphism
When a derived class provides a new implementation for an inherited method, this is called... | Method overriding
What happens when you call an overridden method on an object? | The method from the object's actual class executes, not the base class version
Why is polymorphism essential for code? | It creates more maintainable and modular code
What are the four main principles of OOP? | Classes/Objects, Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism
In the syntax "objectName.methodName()", what does the dot represent? | Dot notation used to access methods or attributes of an object
What happens when a derived class object calls a method that exists in both the base and derived class? | The derived class version (overriding method) is executed
Can a variable of a base class type hold a derived class object? | Yes, this is allowed through polymorphism
What is the purpose of making attributes private? | To protect data from direct external access and modification
How do you access or modify private attributes from outside a class? | Through public methods (getters and setters)
What does a getter method do? | Returns the value of a private attribute
What does a setter method do? | Allows modification of a private attribute's value
Why might changes to private methods have less impact than public methods? | Private methods are only used internally within the class
What is the relationship between a Car class and a Vehicle class if Car inherits from Vehicle? | Car "IS-A" Vehicle
