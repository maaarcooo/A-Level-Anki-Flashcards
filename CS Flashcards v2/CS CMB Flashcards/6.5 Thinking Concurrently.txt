What is concurrent processing? | Multiple processes/tasks running on a single processor by giving each process a fraction of time and control before swapping to another process
Multiple processes/tasks running on a single processor by giving each a fraction of time before swapping to another process is called what? | Concurrent processing
What is parallel processing? | Multiple processes running at the same time over multiple processor cores to enable faster computations
Multiple processes running simultaneously over multiple processor cores is called what? | Parallel processing
How many processors does concurrent processing use? | A single processor
How many processors does parallel processing use? | Multiple processor cores
In concurrent processing, how is the illusion of simultaneous execution created? | By giving each task a slice (timeslice) of processor time and rapidly switching between them
What is concurrent thinking? | The mindset that allows you to spot patterns and parts of problems where concurrency can be applied
The mindset that allows you to identify where concurrency can be applied in problems is called what? | Concurrent thinking
What is the key difference between concurrent processing and concurrent thinking? | Concurrent processing uses a computer processor, while concurrent thinking uses your brain
What must developers consider when determining which parts of a problem can be tackled at the same time? | Dependencies
What are dependencies in the context of concurrent processing? | Tasks that rely on other tasks in order to either start or complete
Tasks that rely on other tasks to start or complete are called what? | Dependencies
Why can't all tasks be performed concurrently? | Some tasks have dependencies - they rely on other tasks to complete first
Give an example of a dependency in construction. | A roof cannot be put on a house if the walls aren't fully built, and walls cannot be built unless the foundation is in place
Give an example of a dependency in finance. | A person's taxes cannot be calculated until all of their income has been input and all deductibles taken into account
When can data sets in a batch program be run in parallel? | When data sets do not relate, rely, or interact with each other
What are two benefits of running programs on multiple cores? | Increased time efficiency and maximised resource usage
What is a benefit of concurrent processing regarding task completion? | The number of tasks completed in a given time is increased (increased program throughput)
What is a benefit of concurrent processing regarding waiting time? | Less time is wasted waiting for an input or user interaction, as other tasks can be completed
How does concurrent processing handle waiting for user input? | It swaps to another task and waits for an operating system interrupt before swapping back to the waiting task
What is a drawback of concurrent processing with large numbers of users or tasks? | Processes take longer to complete as each is allocated a certain timeslice and cannot be completed at once
What is the overhead drawback of concurrent processing? | There is an overhead in coordinating and switching between processes, which reduces program throughput
Why are not all tasks suited for concurrent processing? | Some tasks cannot be broken up and performed concurrently due to dependencies or their nature
In concurrent processing, are tasks truly executed simultaneously? | No, they are executed sequentially but appear simultaneous due to rapid switching
What type of programs commonly use parallel computing to improve speed? | Photo/video editing software and AAA games
Why do modern programs use parallel computing? | To complete multiple tasks at the same time, improving running speed and maximising resource usage and efficiency
What happens to a virus scan and game when run with concurrent processing? | The virus scan is allocated a few microseconds of execution time, then the game is allocated a few microseconds, rapidly alternating between them
Why does concurrent processing appear simultaneous to humans? | Human brains have very slow information processing speeds compared to the rapid switching between tasks
What is a benefit of parallel processing for repetitive calculations? | It can speed up performance by splitting processes over several processors
What is a disadvantage of parallel processing regarding communication? | Different processors running programs simultaneously may need to communicate, leading to overhead and delays
Why might some tasks run faster on a single processor than multiple processors? | Some tasks may be optimised to run on a single processor rather than multiple processors
How can GPUs render 3D objects quickly? | By splitting the computations of a scene between multiple cores using parallel processing
What determines whether related sections of a problem can be solved simultaneously? | Whether they have dependencies - related sections without dependencies can often be dealt with concurrently
What allows multiple batch programs to make progress in a shorter time frame? | Interchanging and pipelining them using concurrent processing on the same processor
What is a timeslice in concurrent processing? | A fraction of processor time allocated to each process before switching to another
