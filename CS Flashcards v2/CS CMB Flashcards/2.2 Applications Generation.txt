What is systems software? | Low-level software responsible for running the computer system smoothly, interacting with hardware and providing a platform for applications software to run
Low-level software responsible for running the computer system smoothly and providing a platform for applications is called what? | Systems software
Does the user directly interact with systems software? | No, but it ensures high performance for the user
Give four examples of systems software | Library programs, utility programs, operating system, device drivers
What are the two main categories of software? | Applications software and systems software
What are utilities? | System software integral to ensuring consistent, high performance of the operating system, with each utility having a specific function linked to OS maintenance

What does the compression utility do? | Enables files to be compressed and decompressed for transmission across the Internet or to reduce file size
What does the disk defragmentation utility do? | Rearranges the contents of the hard drive so files can be accessed faster, improving performance
Why do files become fragmented on a hard disk? | As the hard disk becomes full, files are stored in different parts of memory rather than contiguous blocks
What happens to read/write times when a hard disk becomes full and fragmented? | Read/write times slow down
What does antivirus software do? | Detects potential threats to the computer, alerts the user, and removes these threats
What does the automatic updating utility do? | Ensures the operating system is kept up to date, with updates automatically installed when the computer is restarted
Why are automatic updates important for security? | Updates tackle bugs or security flaws, making the system less vulnerable to malware and hacking threats
What does the backup utility do? | Automatically creates routine copies of specific files selected by the user at intervals specified by the user
Why is the backup utility important? | In the event of power failure, malicious attack or other accident, files can be recovered
What is source code? | Code written by a programmer before it has been compiled (object code before compilation)
What does 'open source' software mean? | Software where the source code can be used by anyone without a license and is distributed with the source code
What does 'closed source' software mean? | Software that requires an appropriate license to use, where users cannot access the source code as the company owns the copyright license
Software that can be used by anyone without a license and is distributed with the source code is called what? | Open source software
Software that requires a license and where the source code is hidden and proprietary is called what? | Closed source software
Give two advantages of open source software | Can be modified and improved by anyone; technical support from online community; can be modified and sold on
Give two advantages of closed source software | Thorough, regular and well-tested updates; company provides expert support and user manuals; high levels of security as developed professionally
Give two disadvantages of open source software | Support may be insufficient or incorrect with no user manuals; lower security as may not be developed in a controlled environment
Give two disadvantages of closed source software | License restricts how many people can use the software at once; users cannot modify and improve software themselves
What factors should a user consider when choosing between open and closed source software? | Suitability to the task, costs (implementation, maintenance, training, license), and functionality (features available, ease of use)
What is a translator in computing? | A program that converts high-level source code into low-level object code ready to be executed by a computer
A program that converts high-level source code into low-level object code is called what? | A translator
What are the three types of translator? | Compiler, interpreter, assembler
What is high-level code? | Code that is written and understood by the programmer but not the computer
What is low-level code? | Code that can be executed by a computer but cannot be directly understood by programmers
What is a compiler? | A translator that translates high-level code into machine code all at once, after carrying out checks and reporting errors
How does a compiler translate code? | It translates the entire source code into machine code all at once
What happens if changes need to be made to compiled code? | The whole program must be recompiled
Is compiled code portable between different systems? | No, compiled code is specific to a particular processor type and operating system
Can compiled code run without a translator being present? | Yes, once compiled, code can run without the translator
What is an interpreter? | A translator that translates and executes code line-by-line, stopping and producing an error if a line contains an error
How does an interpreter translate code? | Line-by-line, executing each line as it is translated
What happens when an interpreter encounters an error? | It stops and produces an error at that line
Why might interpreters initially appear faster than compilers? | Code is instantly executed without waiting for full compilation
Why are interpreters actually slower than compiled code overall? | Code must be translated each time it is executed
Why are interpreters useful for testing and debugging? | They can pinpoint errors without wasting time compiling the entire program first
Does interpreted code require a translator to run? | Yes, an interpreter must be present on the device
Why is interpreted code considered more portable than compiled code? | It can be executed on a range of platforms as long as the right interpreter is available
What is assembly code? | A low-level language that is the 'next level up' from machine code
Why is assembly code considered platform specific? | The instructions used are dependent on the instruction set of the processor
What is an assembler? | A translator that translates assembly code into machine code
How does an assembler translate code? | On almost a one-to-one basis (each line of assembly code is equivalent to almost one line of machine code)
What are the four stages of compilation? | Lexical analysis, syntax analysis, code generation, optimisation
What happens during lexical analysis? | Whitespace and comments are removed; remaining code is analysed for keywords and variable/constant names which are replaced with tokens; a symbol table is created
What is a token in compilation? | A replacement for keywords, identifiers, operators, and separators in the source code during lexical analysis
What is a symbol table? | A table storing information about the token associated with each keyword or identifier during compilation
What happens during syntax analysis? | Tokens are analysed against the grammar and rules of the programming language; syntax errors are flagged and added to an error list
What is parsing? | The process used to check each line of code is well-formed during syntax analysis
Give two examples of syntax errors | Undeclared variable type, incomplete set of brackets
What is an abstract syntax tree (AST)? | A representation of the source code in the form of a tree, produced during syntax analysis
What is semantic analysis? | Analysis carried out during syntax analysis to detect logic mistakes within the program
Give two examples of semantic errors | Multiple declaration, undeclared identifiers
What happens during code generation? | The abstract syntax tree is used to produce machine code
What is the purpose of the optimisation stage? | To search through code for areas it could be made more efficient, making code faster to execute
What is the aim of optimisation? | To make the code faster to execute
What is a potential downside of the optimisation stage? | It can significantly add to the overall time taken for compilation
What happens to redundant code during optimisation? | Insignificant, redundant parts of code are detected and removed
What happens to repeated code sections during optimisation? | They may be grouped and replaced with a more efficient piece of code producing the same result
What is a danger of excessive optimisation? | It may alter the way in which the program behaves
What is a linker? | Software responsible for linking external modules and libraries included within the code
What does a linker do? | Links external modules and libraries included within the code to create a single executable
What are the two types of linker? | Static and dynamic
What is static linking? | Modules and libraries are added directly into the main file at compile time
What is a disadvantage of static linking? | It increases the size of the file
What is an advantage of static linking? | Updates to external modules/libraries will not affect the program; a specific version of a library can be used
What is dynamic linking? | Addresses of modules and libraries are included in the file where they are referenced, and retrieved at runtime
What are the advantages of dynamic linking? | Files remain small; external updates feed through to the main file without rewriting code
What is a loader? | A program provided by the operating system that retrieves libraries or subroutines from memory when a file is executed
What does a loader do? | Retrieves the library or subroutine from the given memory location when a program is run
What are libraries in programming? | Pre-compiled programs which can be incorporated within other programs using static or dynamic linking
Why are libraries described as ready-to-use and error free? | They have been pre-compiled and tested, saving time developing and testing modules
What is a benefit of libraries being reusable? | They can be reused within multiple programs
Why do libraries save programmers from 'reinventing the wheel'? | They provide specialised functions that would otherwise require a lot of time and effort to develop
What types of functions do popular libraries commonly provide? | Mathematical and graphical functions
What is one advantage of using code libraries? | Saves development time by providing pre-written and well-tested code functions
What is one disadvantage of using code libraries? | Can add unnecessary complexity if an extensive library is used for minor functionality; dependency issues if library becomes unsupported
What is the purpose of device driver utility software? | To provide an interface between the hardware and the operating system
What does file management utility software do? | Organises, searches, renames, and relocates files stored on the system
What does system cleanup utility software do? | Frees up space on the system by removing temporary files, system cache, unused applications and other unnecessary data
Do modern SSDs require defragmentation? | No, modern SSDs generally don't require defragmentation
What is machine code also known as? | Object code
What types of tokens are identified during lexical analysis? | Keywords, identifiers, operators, and separators
Give examples of keywords as tokens | var, const, function, for, while, if, return
Give examples of operators as tokens | +, ++, -, *, =, >
Give examples of separators as tokens | , ; { } ( )
What is an identifier token? | Variable names and function names in the source code
Why does compiled code only run on certain devices? | Compiled code is specific to a particular processor type and operating system
What is the difference between syntax errors and semantic errors? | Syntax errors break the grammatical rules of the language; semantic errors are logic mistakes within the program
