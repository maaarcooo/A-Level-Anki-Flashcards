What is an operating system? | A collection of programs that work together to provide an interface between the user and computer, managing hardware and software resources
What provides an interface between the user and the hardware? | The operating system
What are the main functions of an operating system? | Resource management, file management, interrupt handling, security, providing a platform for software, providing a user interface, and providing utilities
What does resource management in an OS involve? | Managing the CPU, memory, disk drives, and printers - allocating resources to specific tasks and ensuring effective use
What does file management in an OS involve? | Handling the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data files
What security features do operating systems provide? | Password-protected system accounts, firewall, virus scanning, and file encryption
Name five examples of utility software | Disk defragmentation, file compression, file encryption, system backup, and disk cleanup
What does disk defragmentation do? | Physically reorganises files on the hard disk so they can be found and accessed faster
What does file compression do? | Reduces the size of a file, helping send large files over a network
What does disk cleanup do? | Scans the hard disk for duplicate and corrupt files and deletes them to create more space
What does backup software do? | Allows users to restore their system to a point in history
What are the two types of user interface operating systems provide? | Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Command-Line Interface (CLI)
What is memory management? | A fundamental role of the OS dealing with the allocation and deallocation of the computer's primary memory
Why is memory management important? | It enables multitasking (multiple programs running at once) and maintains security by preventing programs from accessing memory reserved for other programs
What are the three techniques for memory management? | Paging, segmentation, and virtual memory
What is paging? | A method of dividing memory into fixed-sized, equal blocks called pages
How does paging work? | Programs are made up of equally-sized pages that can be swapped between main memory and the hard disk as needed
What is a disadvantage of paging? | It can lead to internal fragmentation - unused space within pages that cannot be used by other data
What is internal fragmentation? | Wasted space within fixed-size memory pages when the data doesn't completely fill the page
What is segmentation? | A method of dividing memory into variable-sized blocks (segments) that correspond to different types of data needed by an application
How do segments differ from pages? | Segments are not all the same size - they are sized depending on their allocated data and represent the logical structure of the program
What is an advantage of segmentation? | It is space-efficient due to only allocating space depending on the amount an application needs
What is a disadvantage of segmentation? | It can lead to external fragmentation - physical gaps that reduce the maximum size of new segments
What is external fragmentation? | When physical gaps between segments reduce the maximum size of new segments that can be allocated
What is virtual memory? | A section of the hard drive that acts as RAM when the space in main memory is insufficient
How does virtual memory work? | The OS offloads data from primary memory into virtual memory, creating an illusion of larger memory and enabling continued multitasking
What is a disadvantage of virtual memory? | Accessing data in virtual memory is considerably slower compared to RAM
What is disk thrashing? | When the computer 'freezes' due to pages being swapped too frequently between the hard disk and main memory
When does disk thrashing occur? | When more time is spent transferring pages between main memory and hard disk than actually running programs, often as virtual memory fills up
What is an interrupt? | A signal generated by software or hardware to indicate to the processor that a process needs attention
What are the three types of interrupts? | Hardware interrupts, software interrupts, and trap interrupts
What are hardware interrupts? | Interrupts generated by external devices (e.g., keyboard input, mouse movements, disk I/O requests)
What are software interrupts? | Interrupts triggered by software or the operating system (e.g., application requests to open a file, division by zero errors)
What are trap interrupts? | Interrupts intentionally triggered by a program (e.g., software debugging, handling unexpected error cases)
Where are interrupts stored? | In a priority queue in a special register known as the interrupt register
When does the processor check for interrupts? | At the end of each Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle
What is an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)? | A special function that handles a particular interrupt type
What happens when a higher-priority interrupt occurs during execution? | The current contents of the CPU registers are saved to a stack, then the processor loads and executes the appropriate ISR
What happens after an ISR completes? | The flag is reset, the interrupt queue is checked for more priority interrupts, and if none exist, register contents are restored from the stack
What is interrupt nesting? | The ability of the processor to handle interrupts within interrupts
Why is interrupt prioritisation important? | Because many things can go wrong at the same time, and the processor needs to handle the most critical issues first
What is scheduling? | Deciding which tasks to process, for how long, and in what order using scheduling algorithms
What are the two categories of scheduling algorithms? | Pre-emptive and non-pre-emptive
What is pre-emptive scheduling? | Scheduling where the CPU is allocated for time-limited slots and jobs are actively made to start and stop by the OS
What is non-pre-emptive scheduling? | Scheduling where once a job is started, it is left alone until it is completed
Name three pre-emptive scheduling algorithms | Round Robin, Shortest Remaining Time First, and Multi-Level Feedback Queues
Name two non-pre-emptive scheduling algorithms | First Come First Served and Shortest Job First
What is Round Robin scheduling? | A pre-emptive algorithm where each job is given an equal time slice; incomplete jobs move to the back of the queue
What is a time slice/time quantum? | A section of processor time allocated to each job in Round Robin scheduling
What is a disadvantage of Round Robin? | Longer jobs take much longer to complete due to execution being split into multiple cycles, and it doesn't consider job priority
What is First Come First Served (FCFS) scheduling? | A non-pre-emptive algorithm where jobs are processed in the chronological order they entered the queue
What is an advantage of FCFS? | It is simple and easy to understand
What is a disadvantage of FCFS? | It doesn't allocate processor time based on priority, and long processes can delay shorter ones
What is Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) scheduling? | A pre-emptive priority algorithm using multiple queues ordered by different priorities, where shorter and more critical tasks are processed first
How does MLFQ work? | All processes join the highest priority queue but trickle down to lower priority queues if they exceed the time quantum
What is a disadvantage of MLFQ? | It is difficult to implement due to deciding how to prioritise based on a combination of priorities
What is Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling? | A non-pre-emptive algorithm where jobs are ordered by time required for completion, with shortest jobs serviced first
What is a disadvantage of SJF? | It requires knowing how long each job will take, which isn't always possible, and risks processor starvation for longer jobs
What is Shortest Remaining Time (SRT) scheduling? | A pre-emptive version of SJF where jobs are ordered by time left for completion, with jobs nearest completion serviced first
What is processor starvation? | When a particular process does not receive enough processor time to execute and be completed
What type of systems is SJF most suited for? | Batch systems, where shorter jobs are given preference to minimise waiting time
What is a distributed operating system? | An OS run across multiple devices, allowing the load to be spread across multiple computer processors
What is an embedded operating system? | An OS built to perform a small range of specific tasks, catered towards a specific device (e.g., microwaves, washing machines)
What are characteristics of embedded operating systems? | Limited functionality, hard to update, but consume significantly less power than other OS types
What is a multi-tasking operating system? | An OS that enables the user to carry out tasks seemingly simultaneously using time slicing to switch quickly between programs
What is a multi-user operating system? | An OS where multiple users make use of one computer, using scheduling to ensure processor time is shared fairly
What is a real-time operating system (RTOS)? | An OS designed to perform a task within a guaranteed time frame, used in time-critical computer systems
Give examples of where real-time OS are used | Nuclear power station control rods, self-driving cars, aerospace, automotive - any situation where response within a certain time is crucial to safety
What does BIOS stand for? | Basic Input Output System
What is the BIOS? | The first program that runs when a computer system is switched on, stored as firmware on a small memory chip on the motherboard
What does POST stand for? | Power-On Self-Test
What does POST do? | A diagnostic testing sequence that ensures all hardware components (keyboards, disk drives) are correctly connected and functional
What tests does the BIOS run? | POST (hardware check), checking CPU clock/memory/processor is operational, testing for external memory devices
What happens after BIOS tests are completed? | The operating system can be loaded into RAM from the hard disk via the bootstrap/bootloader program
What is a bootstrap/bootloader? | The program that loads the operating system from the hard disk into main memory
What would happen if the BIOS was destroyed? | The computer would be unable to perform POST or load the bootstrap program, so the OS would fail to start
What is a device driver? | A computer program provided by the OS that allows the operating system to interact with hardware
Why are device drivers needed? | To enable communication between the OS and specific hardware devices like printers, graphics cards, and network cards
Why are device drivers specific to different devices? | Because they are specific to the computer's architecture and the operating system installed
What is an example of abstraction related to device drivers? | Users can interact with hardware without knowing details about how it works
What is a virtual machine? | A software implementation of a computer system that provides an environment with a translator for intermediate code to run
What is intermediate code? | Code that is halfway between machine code and object code, independent of processor architecture
Why is intermediate code useful? | It can be used across different machines and operating systems due to being processor-independent
What is a use of virtual machines for programmers? | Creating development environments to test programs on different operating systems without purchasing multiple devices
What is a disadvantage of running code in a virtual machine? | It can be considerably slower compared to running low-level code on the device it was designed for
How can virtual machines protect against malware? | Malware will affect the virtual machine rather than the device being used
How do virtual machines help with incompatible software? | Programs specific to different operating systems or OS versions can be run within a VM
What is hypervisor software? | Software that allows a physical machine to run multiple virtual machines
What does a virtual machine mimic? | A complete computer system including virtual CPU, memory, storage, and network interface
What is an example of intermediate code execution? | Java compiles to bytecode which is executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
What is a benefit of virtual machines for software testing? | They create isolated test environments that leave the host operating system unaffected
What is a drawback of over-using virtual machines? | They can exhaust the host OS of CPU, hard disk, and memory resources
What is a priority queue? | An abstract data structure where interrupts are stored in order of their priority
What is a flag used for in the ISR process? | To signal that the ISR has begun, and is reset once the interrupt has been serviced
What is a stack used for in the interrupt process? | To temporarily store the current contents of the CPU registers while an interrupt is being serviced
What does the Program Counter point to on startup? | The location of the BIOS in memory
Give examples of interrupts | Printer signalling completion of a print job, peripheral signalling power failure, keyboard input, mouse movements
What happens if the processor receives an interrupt with lower priority than the current process? | The contents of the stack are transferred back to the registers and the F-D-E cycle resumes
Why might operating systems use virtual memory? | When main memory is insufficient to store all programs being used
What sections of programs are moved to virtual memory? | Sections that are not currently in use
How does time slicing enable multi-tasking? | By switching quickly between programs and applications in memory, making them appear to run simultaneously
What risk exists in multi-user systems without proper scheduling? | Processor starvation - where a process doesn't get adequate processor time to execute and complete
Give examples of desktop operating systems | Windows, macOS, Linux, Ubuntu
Give examples of mobile operating systems | iOS, Android
What is the purpose of a firewall as an OS security feature? | To monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules
What is burst time in scheduling? | The time a process needs to complete its execution on the CPU
