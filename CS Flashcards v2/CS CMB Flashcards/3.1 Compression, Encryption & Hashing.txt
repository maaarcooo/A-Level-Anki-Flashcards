What is compression?|The process of reducing the storage space required by a file
Why is compression important for networks?|Smaller files transfer faster, reducing transmission time and bandwidth consumption
What are the two categories of compression?|Lossy and lossless compression
What is lossy compression?|Compression that reduces file size by permanently removing some data
What is lossless compression?|Compression that reduces file size without losing any information
Can the original file be recovered from lossy compression?|No, the removed data is permanently lost
Can the original file be recovered from lossless compression?|Yes, the original file can be fully restored
Give an example of how audio files can be compressed using lossy compression|By removing very high or very low frequencies that are least noticeable to the human ear
What type of compression results in a more pixelated image or less clear audio?|Lossy compression
What is a benefit of lossy compression?|Greatly reduced file sizes, suitable for media streaming
What is a drawback of lossy compression?|Irreversible loss of data quality, not suitable for text or archival storage
What is a benefit of lossless compression?|Maintains original data integrity, best for text and data that require accuracy
What is a drawback of lossless compression?|Larger file sizes than lossy compression, requires high bandwidth when streaming
When should you recommend lossless compression?|When data integrity is imperative
When should you recommend lossy compression?|When achieving a small file size or quick data transfer is prioritised and some data loss is acceptable
What is Run Length Encoding (RLE)?|A method of lossless compression where repeated values are replaced with one occurrence of the data followed by the number of times it should be repeated
How would the string "AAAAAABBBBBCCC" be represented using RLE?|A6B5C3
What type of data works well with Run Length Encoding?|Data with consecutive pieces that are the same (high repetition)
When does RLE not offer a great reduction in file size?|When there is little repetition in the data
What type of compression is Run Length Encoding?|Lossless compression
RLE is used in what type of images to compress sequences of the same colour?|Bitmap images
What is dictionary encoding/coding?|A lossless compression method where frequently occurring pieces of data are replaced with shorter index codes from a dictionary
How does dictionary encoding work?|Frequently occurring data is replaced with an index, and compressed data is stored alongside a dictionary that matches the data to its index
What must be transferred alongside data compressed using dictionary compression?|The dictionary, otherwise the data cannot be used
What type of compression is dictionary encoding?|Lossless compression
Which lossless compression method is more effective when data has lots of repetition?|Run Length Encoding (RLE)
Which lossless compression method is more versatile but may require more computational resources?|Dictionary coding
What is encryption?|A method used to keep data secure by scrambling it before transmission and deciphering it at the destination
What are keys in encryption?|Specialised programs designed to scramble or unscramble data
What are the two main types of encryption?|Symmetric and asymmetric encryption
What is symmetric encryption?|Encryption where both sender and receiver share the same private key for encrypting and decrypting data
What is the process of distributing the shared key in symmetric encryption called?|Key exchange
How many keys are used in symmetric encryption?|One key (the same key for encryption and decryption)
What is a major vulnerability of symmetric encryption?|If the private key is intercepted during key exchange, all communications can be decrypted
Is symmetric encryption generally faster or slower than asymmetric encryption?|Faster
What type of data is symmetric encryption ideal for?|Large files and databases where key distribution is not an issue
What is asymmetric encryption?|Encryption that uses two mathematically related keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption
How many keys are used in asymmetric encryption?|Two keys (a public key and a private key)
What is the pair of public and private keys called in asymmetric encryption?|A key pair
Can the public key in asymmetric encryption be shared openly?|Yes, it can be published anywhere
Must the private key in asymmetric encryption be kept secret?|Yes, it must be kept secret
In asymmetric encryption, messages encrypted with the recipient's public key can only be decrypted with what?|The recipient's private key
How does asymmetric encryption solve the key distribution problem of symmetric encryption?|The public key can be openly shared without compromising the private key
Is asymmetric encryption generally faster or slower than symmetric encryption?|Slower
What type of data is asymmetric encryption generally used for?|More secure and smaller data transactions (e.g., passwords, bank details)
How can you prove a message was sent by you using asymmetric encryption?|Encrypt it with your private key; anyone can decrypt it with your public key, proving you sent it
What system is based on encrypting with a private key to prove message authenticity?|Digital signatures
When should symmetric encryption be chosen over asymmetric?|When speed is prioritised and key distribution is secure
When should asymmetric encryption be chosen over symmetric?|When high security is needed and key distribution could be compromised
What is hashing?|A process where an input (key) is converted into a fixed-size value (hash) using a hash function
What is the input to a hash function called?|A key
What is the output of a hash function called?|A hash (or hash digest)
What are algorithms that convert input into fixed-size hash values called?|Hash functions
Can the output of a hash function be reversed to obtain the original input?|No, hashing is a one-way function
Why is hashing useful for storing passwords?|Because hashes cannot be reversed, so even if hackers access the hashes, they cannot obtain the original passwords
How is a user's password verified using hashing?|The entered password is hashed and compared against the stored hash; if they match, access is granted
What is a hash table?|A data structure that holds key-value pairs, formed from a bucket array and hash function, allowing constant time data lookup
What are hash tables used for?|Situations where lots of data needs to be stored with constant access times (e.g., caches and databases)
What is a hash collision?|When two different pieces of data (keys) produce the same hash value
What are two methods to overcome hash collisions?|Storing items together in a list under the hash value, or using a second hash function to generate a new hash
What makes a good hash function? (3 characteristics)|Low chance of collision, quick to calculate, and output smaller than input
Why should hash output be smaller than input?|Otherwise searching for the hash could take longer than simply searching for the key
What is MD5?|Message Digest 5 - a widely used but now considered weak hashing algorithm due to collision vulnerabilities
What is SHA-1?|Secure Hash Algorithm 1 - previously used in SSL certificates and software repositories, now considered weak
What is SHA-256?|A member of the SHA-2 family, commonly used in cryptographic applications and data integrity checks, considered secure
What is SHA-3?|The most recent member of the Secure Hash Algorithm family, designed to provide higher levels of security
What happens to the hash output when there is even a minor change in the input?|The hash changes radically (sensitivity to data changes)
What provides consistency in hashing?|The same input will always produce the same hash
When a user signs up, how is their password stored securely?|The password is hashed and the hash is stored in the database, not the plaintext password
Why does hashing passwords minimise risk in a data breach?|Users' raw passwords are not exposed since only hashes are stored
Why is hashing efficient for database lookups?|Hash digests have a fixed length, making comparison easier than comparing variable-length strings
How can hashing verify data integrity during network transfer?|By comparing hashes before and after transfer; identical hashes confirm data was not corrupted or tampered with
What is the purpose of encryption?|Securing data for transmission or storage (reversible)
What is the purpose of hashing?|Data verification and quick data retrieval (irreversible)
Does encryption use keys?|Yes, keys are used for encryption and decryption
Does hashing use keys?|No, no keys are involved in hashing
