What is a decision in problem solving? | A result reached after some consideration
What is a programming paradigm? | A particular approach to programming
What shape represents a decision in a flowchart? | A diamond shape
What are the two possible results of a decision in a flowchart? | Yes or No (True/False)
What three key factors should be considered when making a decision? | Effectiveness, convenience, and feasibility (reasonableness)
How should you evaluate conditions to make an appropriate decision? | Order them from most important to least important
Why is it important to identify where decisions will need to be made when building solutions? | It allows you to gather enough information about your options to make an informed decision
What is thinking logically in programming? | Planning and preparing for different scenarios by foreseeing decisions made throughout the whole program
What are the three structured programming techniques? | Sequence, selection, and iteration
What is sequence in structured programming? | One statement after another
What is selection in structured programming? | Decision making using if/then/else or switch/case statements
What is iteration in structured programming? | Loops using for/while/do while/do until
What is the purpose of structured programming techniques? | To aid the readability, understanding, and maintainability of code
What is a block-structured language? | A language that uses only sequence, selection, and iteration to control the flow of execution and data
Give an example of a block-structured language | Python
What should each block of code have according to structured programming principles? | A single entry and exit point
Why should breaking out of iterative blocks be minimised? | To prevent unintended consequences relating to the flow of control such as entering or leaving a subroutine early or branching unintentionally
What three methods can be used to plan algorithms before coding? | Flowcharts, pseudocode, or structured English
Why are flowcharts useful for identifying decision points? | They visually show the flow of control and make decisions clear and easy to follow
What is a disadvantage of flowcharts? | They are time consuming to create
How does pseudocode differ from programming languages? | Pseudocode mimics programming constructs without the problem of syntax
What is the requirement for pseudocode to be acceptable? | The meaning must be clear
What is a disadvantage of structured English compared to pseudocode? | It is usually more verbose and imprecise
Where do most errors in a program occur? | When evaluating a Boolean condition
In what two programming situations do decisions usually occur? | In if statements/select case or in loops (usually while loops)
What is selection also known as? | Branching
What does selection involve? | Directing the flow of control of a program dependent on a Boolean condition or set of conditions
What does iteration involve? | Repeating a sequence of instructions based on a stopping Boolean condition
What do decisions affect in a program? | The flow of control
What are the comparison operators used in Boolean conditions? | == (equal to), > (greater than), >= (greater than or equal to), < (less than), <= (less than or equal to), != (not equal to)
What does the AND operator require for a true result? | Both conditions must be true
What does the OR operator require for a true result? | Either or both conditions must be true
What does the NOT operator do? | Returns true if the condition is not true
What does the XOR operator require for a true result? | Only one or the other condition must be true (not both)
What is the == operator used for? | Testing if two values are equal to each other
What is the != operator used for? | Testing if two values are not equal to each other
What is the >= operator used for? | Testing if a value is greater than or equal to another value
What is the <= operator used for? | Testing if a value is less than or equal to another value
What should you be careful of when creating Boolean conditions? | Long, complex conditions involving multiple clauses
What does nesting iteration and selection statements allow? | Creating more complex program structures with multiple decision points
What is the purpose of a break instruction in a loop? | To exit the loop early when a certain condition is met
Why should break instructions be used carefully? | They are powerful but can be misused and cause unintended problems
In an if/then/else structure, what happens when the condition is true? | The code in the 'then' block is executed
In an if/then/else structure, what happens when the condition is false? | The code in the 'else' block is executed (if present)
What is a switch/case statement used for? | Selecting one of many code blocks to execute based on the value of a variable
What is the 'default' case in a switch statement? | The code block that executes when no other case matches
What is a nested if statement? | An if statement contained within another if statement
Why is good decision making important in problem solving? | It is the key to solving problems effectively
What factors affect the choice of programming language for a solution? | Suitability to the problem, functionality provided, familiarity, and ease of learning given time constraints
What might the best approach for a solution depend on? | The purpose and end-users of the software
What is a Boolean condition? | A condition that evaluates to either true or false
What type of loop continues until a condition becomes true? | A do until loop (or repeat until loop)
What type of loop continues while a condition remains true? | A while loop
