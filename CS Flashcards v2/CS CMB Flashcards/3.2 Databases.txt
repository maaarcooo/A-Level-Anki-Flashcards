What is a database? | An organised collection of data that allows easy storage, retrieval, and management of information
What is a field in a database? | A single piece of data in a record
What is a record in a database? | A group of related fields representing one data entry (a row in a table)
What is a table in a database? | A collection of records with a similar structure
What is an entity in a database? | An item of interest about which information is stored (becomes a table in a relational database)
What are attributes in a database? | Characteristics of an entity; categories about which data is collected
What is a relational database? | A database that organises data into multiple tables and uses keys to connect related data between different entities
What is a flat file database? | A database that consists of a single file/table, typically based around a single entity and its attributes
What is the standard notation for writing out a flat file? | Entity1(Attribute1, Attribute2, Attribute3...)
What is a primary key? | A unique identifier for each record in a table
How is a primary key shown in database notation? | By underlining it
What is a compound (composite) primary key? | A combination of two or more fields that together is unique for all records
What is a foreign key? | A field in a table that refers to the primary key in another table, used to link tables and create relationships
How is a foreign key shown in database notation? | Using an asterisk (*)
What is a secondary key? | A field or fields that are indexed for faster searching
What is indexing in databases? | A method used to store the position of each record ordered by a certain attribute, allowing quick data lookup and access
Why are secondary keys used instead of primary keys for searching? | Because primary keys are almost never queried since they are not normally remembered by users
What is a Database Management System (DBMS)? | Software used to manage databases (examples: MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL)
Name three benefits of electronic databases over paper-based systems | Easier to add, delete, modify and update data; data can be backed up and copied easier; multiple users from multiple locations can access the same database simultaneously
What problem does a flat file database have with redundant data? | Data is repeated multiple times, causing inefficient storage and potential inconsistencies if changes are made
How does a relational database solve data redundancy? | By storing data in separate tables linked by foreign keys, so each piece of data is stored only once
What is normalisation? | The process of organising a database to reduce data duplication and improve data accuracy and consistency
What are the four goals of normalisation? | No redundancy (unnecessary duplicates), consistent data throughout linked tables, records can be added/removed without issues, complex queries can be carried out
What is First Normal Form (1NF)? | A table where all attributes contain only atomic (single, indivisible) values, has no repeating groups, has unique column names, and has a primary key
What does "atomic" mean in database terms? | Each column contains single, indivisible values (not arrays or lists)
What is Second Normal Form (2NF)? | A table that is in 1NF and has no partial dependencies (no attributes depend on only part of a composite key)
What is a partial dependency? | When a non-prime attribute depends on only part of a composite primary key
What is Third Normal Form (3NF)? | A table that is in 2NF and has no transitive dependencies (non-key attributes depend only on the primary key)
What is a transitive dependency? | When a non-prime attribute depends on another non-prime attribute rather than directly on the primary key
What is the prerequisite for a table to be in 2NF? | It must first be in 1NF
What is the prerequisite for a table to be in 3NF? | It must first be in 2NF
What is a one-to-one relationship? | Each entity can only be linked to one other entity (e.g., husband and wife)
What is a one-to-many relationship? | One entity can be associated with many other entities (e.g., a mother having multiple children)
What is a many-to-many relationship? | One entity can be associated with many other entities and vice versa (e.g., students and courses)

How is a one-to-one relationship shown in an ERD? | A single line connecting two entities
How is a one-to-many relationship shown in an ERD? | A line with a branch (crow's foot) on one side
How is a many-to-many relationship shown in an ERD? | A line with branches (crow's feet) on both sides
Why can't many-to-many relationships be directly implemented in a database? | They need to be resolved by creating a link table between the two entities
How do you resolve a many-to-many relationship? | By creating a new link table that goes between the entities, containing foreign keys to both tables

What does DROP TABLE do in SQL? | Deletes an entire table from the database
What is a nested SELECT in SQL? | A SELECT statement within another SELECT statement (subquery)
What is referential integrity? | The process of ensuring consistency between linked tables, so foreign keys always reference valid primary keys
What happens if referential integrity is violated? | Information could be removed that is required elsewhere in a linked database, causing orphaned records
What is a cascade action in databases? | An automatic update or delete action that affects related records in linked tables
What does CASCADE do in referential integrity? | Automatically makes changes to related records when the primary key is updated or deleted
What does SET NULL do in referential integrity? | Sets the foreign key value to null in related records when the primary key is deleted
What does NO ACTION/RESTRICT do in referential integrity? | Prevents changes if related records exist
What is a transaction in database terms? | A sequence of database operations treated as a single unit of work (or a single operation executed on data)
What does ACID stand for? | Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
What is Atomicity in ACID? | A transaction must be processed in its entirety or not at all - all operations succeed or fail as a whole
What is Consistency in ACID? | A transaction must maintain referential integrity rules between linked tables; the database remains in a consistent state
What is Isolation in ACID? | Simultaneous executions of transactions should lead to the same result as if executed one after the other; transactions are isolated from each other
What is Durability in ACID? | Once a transaction has been executed it will remain so regardless of circumstances (e.g., power cut); committed transactions persist
What is record locking? | A technique that prevents simultaneous access to the same record in a database to prevent inconsistencies or lost updates
What is a shared lock (read lock)? | A lock that allows multiple transactions to read a record simultaneously but prevents modifications
What is an exclusive lock (write lock)? | A lock that allows only one transaction to access and modify a record, blocking all others
What is deadlock in databases? | When two or more transactions are waiting for each other to release resources, causing them to wait indefinitely
Give an example of how deadlock occurs | User 1 locks Record A and needs Record B; User 2 locks Record B and needs Record A; both wait indefinitely for the other
What is redundancy in databases? | Having one or more copies of data stored in different locations (can refer to either unwanted duplicate data or intentional backup copies)
Why is data redundancy used for backup purposes? | So that if one copy is damaged, other copies remain unaffected and can be recovered
What problem does unwanted data redundancy cause? | Data inconsistencies if changes are made to only some copies, and wasted storage space
What is concurrency control? | Managing simultaneous access to data in a multi-user environment
What are two techniques for concurrency control? | Locking (prevents multiple transactions accessing same data) and Timestamping (assigns unique timestamp to each transaction)
What is commit in transaction processing? | An operation that saves all changes made in a transaction as permanent
What is rollback in transaction processing? | An operation that reverts/undoes all changes made in a transaction
What is logging and recovery in databases? | Keeping a log of all changes so the system can recover to a consistent state after a crash
