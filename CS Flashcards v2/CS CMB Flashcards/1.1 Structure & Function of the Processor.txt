What are the three stages of the fetch-decode-execute cycle? | Fetch, Decode, Execute
Describe the first step of the Fetch phase | The address from the PC is copied to the MAR
Describe the second step of the Fetch phase | The instruction held at that address is copied to MDR via the data bus
What happens to the PC during the Fetch phase? | The contents of the PC are increased by 1
Describe the final step of the Fetch phase | The value held in the MDR is copied to the CIR

What is pipelining? | The process of completing the fetch, decode, and execute cycles of three separate instructions simultaneously
Where is data held during pipelining? | In a buffer in close proximity to the CPU until it's required
What is the aim of pipelining? | To reduce the amount of CPU time kept idle
What are the two types of pipelining? | Instruction pipelining and arithmetic pipelining
What is instruction pipelining? | Separating out the instruction into fetching, decoding, and executing stages
What is arithmetic pipelining? | Breaking down arithmetic operations and overlapping them as they are performed
What happens to the pipeline when a branch instruction occurs? | The pipeline is flushed
How does pipelining improve processor performance? | It reduces latency; the CPU is not idle while waiting for the next instruction
What are the three factors affecting CPU performance? | Clock speed, number of cores, and amount/type of cache memory
What is the system clock? | An electronic device which generates signals, switching between 0 and 1
When do processor activities begin? | On a clock pulse, as the clock changes from 0 to 1
What is clock speed? | The time taken for one clock cycle to complete / how many state changes the CPU performs per second
