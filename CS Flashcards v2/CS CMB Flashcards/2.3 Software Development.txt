What is a Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)? | A structured approach to software development with stages including analysis, design, development, testing, implementation, evaluation, and maintenance
What happens during the Analysis stage of software development? | Stakeholders state requirements, the problem is clearly defined, and system requirements are established
How are requirements defined during the Analysis stage? | By analysing strengths and weaknesses of current solutions, and considering types of data involved (inputs, outputs, stored data, amount of data)
What is a stakeholder in software development? | Someone who has an interest in or is affected by the finished software product
What aspects are designed during the Design stage? | Inputs, outputs, security features, hardware set-up, user interface, and a test plan
What factors are considered when designing inputs and outputs? | Volume, methods, and frequency
What factors are considered when designing security features? | Level required and access levels
What factors are considered when designing the user interface? | Menus, accessibility, and navigation
What happens during the Development stage? | The design is split into individual, self-contained modules which are allocated to teams for programming
What is alpha testing? | Testing carried out in-house by software development teams within the company to pinpoint and fix bugs
What is beta testing? | Testing carried out by end-users after alpha testing, with feedback used to inform the next stage of development
What is white box testing? | Testing carried out by software development teams where the test plan is based on the internal structure of the program and all possible routes through the program are tested
What is black box testing? | Testing where software is tested without testers being aware of the internal structure, tracing through inputs and outputs
Who can carry out black box testing? | Both the company (in-house) and end-users
What happens during the Implementation stage? | The software is installed onto the users' systems after testing changes have been made
What happens during the Evaluation stage? | The effectiveness of the software is evaluated against system requirements to assess its suitability in solving the problem
What criteria are considered during Evaluation? | Robustness, reliability, portability, and maintainability
What happens during the Maintenance stage? | End-users flag errors or improvements, and programmers send out software updates to fix bugs, security issues, or make improvements
What is the Waterfall lifecycle model? | A sequential software development process divided into distinct phases, where each phase must be completed before the next begins
What are the stages of the Waterfall model? | Requirements/Analysis, Design, Implementation/Development, Testing, Deployment, Evaluation, Maintenance
What is a feasibility study? | An evaluation conducted during the analysis stage to determine if a project is viable using TELOS criteria
What does TELOS stand for? | Technical, Economic, Legal, Operational, Scheduling
What does the T in TELOS assess? | Technical feasibility - is the project possible considering the technology available and accessible?
What does the E in TELOS assess? | Economic feasibility - can the project be financed in the short-term and long-term?
What does the L in TELOS assess? | Legal feasibility - can the project be solved within the law?
What does the O in TELOS assess? | Operational feasibility - can the project be successfully implemented and maintained?
What does the S in TELOS assess? | Scheduling feasibility - can the project be completed given the time available?
Why is the Waterfall model considered inflexible? | If a change needs to be made, programmers must revisit all levels between the current stage and the stage where the change is needed
When are users involved in the Waterfall lifecycle? | Only at the very beginning (analysis) and end (evaluation) - meaning limited user input
What are the benefits of the Waterfall model? | Straightforward to manage, clearly documented, simple and linear with clear stages and milestones
What are the drawbacks of the Waterfall model? | Lack of flexibility, no risk analysis, limited user involvement, expensive to fix late problems, long development cycle
What projects is the Waterfall model suitable for? | Static, low-risk projects with well-understood requirements that need little user input (e.g., general-purpose software)
What are Agile methodologies? | A collection of methodologies that aim to improve flexibility of software development and adapt to changes in user requirements faster
How is the problem handled in Agile development? | Broken down into sections which are developed in parallel, with design and analysis phases often occurring together
What is a prototype in Agile development? | A working version delivered early on, which is built upon and improved in an iterative manner
How often are prototypes delivered in Agile? | Regularly throughout the development cycle
What is the focus of Agile compared to traditional methods? | Less focus on documentation and more priority given to user satisfaction
What are the benefits of Agile methodologies? | Produces high quality code, flexible to changing requirements, regular user input, highly adaptable, frequent communication
What are the drawbacks of Agile methodologies? | Poor documentation, requires consistent interaction between user and programmer, scope creep, requires experienced team members
What projects are Agile methodologies suitable for? | Small to medium projects with unclear initial requirements and where requirements can change
What is Extreme Programming (XP)? | An Agile model where the development team consists of a pair of programmers alongside a representative end-user
What are user stories in XP? | System requirements specified by the end-user and used when designing the program
What is paired programming? | A practice where code is written by one person and critiqued by the other, aiming to produce high-quality code
What is the maximum working hours per week in XP? | Forty hours, with the aim that quality is not compromised
What is a 'working version' in XP? | The result of each iteration through the cycle - a version that could function as the final product
What is essential for XP to be effective? | Programmers must communicate effectively
What are the benefits of Extreme Programming? | Produces high quality code, constant user involvement means high usability, quality focus with continuous testing
What are the drawbacks of Extreme Programming? | High cost of two people on one project, teamwork is essential, end-user may not be able to be present, may lack documentation
What projects is Extreme Programming suitable for? | Small to medium projects with unclear initial requirements requiring excellent usability
What is a sprint in Agile/XP? | A short time-boxed development period, usually 1-4 weeks
What is Sprint Planning? | Breaking down requirements into tasks, choosing features for the current sprint, and defining the sprint goal
What is a Sprint Review? | A demo of working software to stakeholders to collect feedback and identify changes or improvements
What is a Sprint Retrospective? | When the team reflects on what went well and what needs improving for the next sprint
What is the Spiral model? | A software development methodology that combines aspects of both iterative (agile) and sequential (waterfall) processes, focused on risk management
What are the four key stages of the Spiral model? | Planning (analysing requirements), Risk analysis (pinpointing and mitigating risks), Engineering (development, testing, implementation), Evaluation (to inform next iteration)
What happens if a project is found too risky in the Spiral model? | The project is terminated
Why is the Spiral model expensive? | Hiring risk assessors to analyse risks is expensive
What projects is the Spiral model suited for? | Very large-scale, complex projects where requirements may change and risk management is essential
What are the benefits of the Spiral model? | Thorough risk-analysis and mitigation, caters to changing user needs, produces prototypes throughout, flexible with incremental releases
What are the drawbacks of the Spiral model? | Expensive to hire risk assessors, lack of focus on code efficiency, high costs due to constant prototyping, complex and time-consuming
What is Rapid Application Development (RAD)? | An iterative methodology that uses partially functioning prototypes which are continually built-upon, emphasising fast development
How are initial requirements gathered in RAD? | Using focus groups
What happens to the prototype in RAD? | An 'incomplete' version is given to users to trial, feedback generates improved prototypes, continuing until requirements are met
When does a RAD prototype become the final product? | When it matches the requirements of end-users
When is RAD commonly used? | Where user requirements are incomplete or unclear at the start
What is a drawback of requirements changing in RAD? | Additions and changes made to code may be inefficient
What are the benefits of RAD? | Caters to changing user requirements, highly usable finished product, focus on core features reduces development time, fast development, user involvement
What are the drawbacks of RAD? | Poorer quality documentation, fast pace may reduce code quality, dependent on strong team collaboration, can lead to scope creep
What projects is RAD suitable for? | Small to medium, low-budget projects with short time-frames requiring rapid delivery
What is an algorithm? | A set of instructions used to solve a problem
What are the key qualities of a good algorithm? | Clearly defined inputs, always produces valid output for defined input, handles invalid inputs, always reaches stopping condition, well-documented, well-commented
Why must algorithm inputs be clearly defined? | To establish what is valid and what is invalid
Why must algorithms be well-documented? | For reference purposes
Why must algorithms be well-commented? | So modifications can easily be made
