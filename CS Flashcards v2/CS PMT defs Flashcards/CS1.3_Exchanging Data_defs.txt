What is atomicity in database transactions? | All transactions should either succeed or fail completely, never partially processed
What does the 'A' in ACID stand for? | Atomicity
What is consistency in database transactions? | Each transaction must obey the defined validation rules to maintain referential integrity

What is durability in database transactions? | Once a transaction has begun, it must be completed under all circumstances
What does the 'D' in ACID stand for? | Durability

What does the 'I' in ACID stand for? | Isolation
What does ACID stand for? | Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
What is entity-relationship modelling? | A method of abstractly describing data tables and relationships between them visually to reduce redundancy and construct relational databases
What is First Normal Form (1NF)? | A table with no repeating attributes where each record-attribute intersection produces exactly one value
What is the key requirement for 1NF? | No repeating attributes; each cell contains exactly one value
What is a flat file database? | A database where a single table data structure stores all the data
What type of database uses only a single table? | Flat file database
What is a foreign key? | A linking attribute that joins two tables by being a primary key in one table and a foreign key in the other
What links two tables in a relational database? | A foreign key
What is indexing in databases? | Creating an index of primary keys so any record's location can be retrieved given its primary key
What is normalisation? | The formal process of optimally designing data tables by reducing redundancy and repetition through conversion to normal forms
What is a primary key? | A unique identifier that identifies each record in a table
What uniquely identifies each record in a database table? | The primary key
What is record locking? | A technique preventing simultaneous access to data by locking a record when being edited or updated
Why is record locking used? | To prevent inconsistencies in the database from simultaneous access
What is redundancy in databases? | The unnecessary repetition of a field in multiple tables
When is redundancy acceptable in databases? | In the form of identical copies for backup/recovery purposes
What is referential integrity? | Keeping a database consistent by ensuring changes to data or relationships are accounted for in all linked tables
What is a relational database? | A database where separate tables are made for each entity and relationships are represented by foreign keys
What is a secondary key? | A key used as an alternative index to access or sort records more quickly but less accurately than the primary key
What is Second Normal Form (2NF)? | A table in 1NF with repeating data across multiple records removed into a new table (no partial dependencies)
What must be removed to achieve 2NF? | Partial dependencies (data repeating across multiple records)
What is Third Normal Form (3NF)? | A table in 2NF where all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key (no non-key dependencies)
What must be removed to achieve 3NF? | Non-key dependencies (transitive dependencies)
What is transaction processing? | Ensuring any logical operation or change to database state conforms to ACID rules for reliable processing
What is circuit switching? | A method for sending data by creating a dedicated communication channel first; all data follows the same path
What type of switching creates a dedicated path for the entire communication? | Circuit switching
What is a client-server network? | A network where client computers connect to central servers that handle service requests and resources
What is a peer-to-peer network? | A network where computers connect to each other and share resources without any central server
What type of network has no central server? | Peer-to-peer network
What is the Domain Name System (DNS)? | A hierarchical naming system that maps human-readable domain names to IP addresses
What does DNS map domain names to? | IP addresses
What is encryption? | Converting plaintext into ciphertext using an encryption algorithm (cipher) so unauthorised users cannot understand it
What is plaintext? | The original, unencrypted data
What is ciphertext? | Encrypted data that cannot be understood by unauthorised users
What is a firewall? | A security application that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic to prevent unauthorised access between networks
What is a Local Area Network (LAN)? | A network connecting computing devices on a single geographical area/site
What is a Wide Area Network (WAN)? | A network connecting computing devices over a large geographical area, typically using third party carriers
What is packet switching? | A method for sending data by breaking it into packets sent independently, then reassembled at the destination
What type of switching breaks data into independently-routed packets? | Packet switching
What is protocol layering? | Dividing a complex network system into functional layers with protocols for each layer to perform tasks and communicate with adjacent layers
What is a proxy server? | A server that intercepts data packets to hide true network addresses and restrict access, isolating the network from external networks
What functions do proxy servers perform? | Hide network addresses, restrict user access, and isolate networks from external networks
What is the TCP/IP stack? | A suite of networking protocols allowing computers to communicate, consisting of 4 connected layers
How many layers does the TCP/IP stack have? | 4 layers
What is CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)? | A style language used to define the layout, design and presentation of a webpage written in a markup language
What language defines webpage layout and presentation? | CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
What is client-side processing? | Data processing performed by the client's browser using local computer resources, typically for less critical code
