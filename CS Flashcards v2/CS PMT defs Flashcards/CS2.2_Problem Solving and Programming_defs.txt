What is branching in programming? | A control structure where the code selects one or more alternative paths depending on the evaluation of a boolean expression
A control structure that selects alternative paths based on a boolean expression is called? | Branching
What is a function in programming? | A subroutine that performs a task or calculation and always returns a value; can be called in an expression or assigned to a variable
A subroutine that always returns a value and can be used in expressions is called? | A function
What is a global variable? | A variable declared in the main program that exists outside any subroutines but can be used anywhere in the program
A variable that can be accessed anywhere in a program but is declared outside subroutines is called? | A global variable
What is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)? | A software package that allows a user to develop and implement code more easily, with features for editing, debugging, version control, testing and compilation
What features does an IDE typically provide? | Editing, debugging, version control, testing and compilation
What is iteration in programming? | A control structure where a set of statements is repeated either a fixed number of times or until a condition is met
A control structure that repeats statements a fixed number of times or until a condition is met is called? | Iteration
What is a local variable? | A variable declared within a subroutine that only exists and can be used within that subroutine
A variable that only exists within the subroutine where it is declared is called? | A local variable
What is modularity? | The technique of breaking down a complex problem into simpler, self-contained components called modules, where each module implements a specific subtask
Breaking a complex problem into simpler, self-contained modules that each handle a specific subtask is called? | Modularity
What is Object Oriented Programming (OOP)? | A programming paradigm where the system is viewed as a set of objects, each with their own attributes and methods, that can interact with each other; all processing is done by objects
In OOP, what are attributes? | The data belonging to an object
In OOP, what are methods? | The procedures belonging to an object
What is parameter passing by reference? | Passing the address or pointer of the required value into a procedure
When you pass the address or pointer of a value into a procedure, this is called? | Parameter passing by reference
What is parameter passing by value? | Creating a temporary local copy of the actual value of a variable and passing it into the procedure
When a temporary local copy of a variable's value is created and passed into a procedure, this is called? | Parameter passing by value
What are parameters? | The data structures required to be passed into a subroutine
What is a procedure? | A subroutine that is called by writing its name in the code and does not have to return a value
A subroutine that does not have to return a value is called? | A procedure
What is recursion? | A programming subroutine where a section of code calls itself until a base case is met
Why must a base case be defined in recursion? | To avoid the possibility of an infinite loop
A subroutine that calls itself until a base case is met is an example of? | Recursion
What is a sequence in programming? | A control structure in which statements are executed one after another as they appear in the script
A control structure where statements execute one after another in order is called? | A sequence
What is a subroutine? | A uniquely named section of code written to perform a specific task within a program
A named section of code that performs a specific task within a program is called? | A subroutine
What is backtracking? | An algorithm that incrementally finds a solution by methodically trying different sequences and abandoning a path when it cannot lead to a valid solution
An algorithm that tries different sequences and abandons paths that cannot lead to a valid solution is called? | Backtracking
What is a computable problem? | A problem for which every instance can be solved in a finite number of steps by means of an algorithm
A problem that can be solved in a finite number of steps using an algorithm is called? | A computable problem
What are computational methods? | Methods of solving a problem using some form of computation in devising and implementing an algorithm
What is data mining? | An algorithm that finds a solution by analysing large data sets to uncover trends and relationships between variables
An algorithm that analyses large data sets to find trends and relationships is called? | Data mining
What is divide and conquer? | An algorithm design technique that decomposes and solves problems by reducing the problem size with each iteration until sub-problems become solvable
An algorithm technique that repeatedly reduces problem size until sub-problems become solvable is called? | Divide and conquer
What are heuristics? | 'Rule of thumb' algorithms that produce a valid but sub-optimal solution for intractable problems as an approximation
Algorithms that provide approximate but sub-optimal solutions to intractable problems are called? | Heuristics
What is performance modelling? | The process of simulating the behaviour of a model under different virtual user and system loads using mathematical approximation
Simulating system behaviour under different loads using mathematical approximation is called? | Performance modelling
What is pipelining? | The process of splitting a task into parts and searching for subtasks that can be processed simultaneously to overlap processing
Splitting a task into parts that can be processed simultaneously to overlap execution is called? | Pipelining
What is problem decomposition? | The process of splitting a problem into smaller, solvable sub-problems that are easier to conceive, understand, maintain and program
Splitting a problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems is called? | Problem decomposition
What is problem recognition? | The ability to recognise the most effective strategy to solve a problem
The ability to identify the most effective strategy for solving a problem is called? | Problem recognition
What is visualisation in computing? | The use of a visual representation of an algorithm or data structure to translate a problem and its solution to a more human-readable form
Using visual representations to make algorithms or data structures more human-readable is called? | Visualisation
What is the key difference between a function and a procedure? | A function always returns a value; a procedure does not have to return a value
What is the key difference between a local and global variable? | A local variable only exists within its subroutine; a global variable can be accessed anywhere in the program
What is the key difference between passing by value and passing by reference? | By value creates a temporary copy of the data; by reference passes the address/pointer to the original data
What are the three main programming control structures? | Sequence, branching (selection), and iteration
